            "body": "\nThis answer merely expands on Fredrik Hedblad's excellent answer.  Being new to WPF and XAML, Fredrik's answer served as a springboard for defining how I wanted validation errors to be displayed in my application.  While the XAML below works for me, it is a work in progress.  I have not fully tested it, and I will readily admit that I cannot fully explain every tag.  With those caveats, I hope this proves useful to others.\n\nWhile the animated TextBlock is a fine approach, it has two shortcomings that I wanted to address.\n\n\nFirst, as Brent's comment noted, the text is constrained by the owning window's borders such that if the invalid control is at the edge of the window, the text is cut off.  Fredrik's suggested solution was to have it displayed \"outside the window.\"  That makes sense to me.\nSecond, showing the TextBlock to the right of the invalid control is not always optimal.  For example, say the TextBlock is used to specify a particular file to open and that there is a Browse button to its right.  If the user types in a non-existent file, the error TextBlock will cover the Browse button and potentially prevent the user from clicking it to correct the mistake.  What makes sense to me is to have the error message displayed diagonally up and to the right of the invalid control.  This accomplishes two things.  First, it avoids hiding any companion controls to the right of the invalid control.  It also has the visual effect that the toolTipCorner is pointing toward the error message.\n\n\nHere is the dialog around which I've done my development.\n\n\n\nAs you can see, there are two TextBox controls that need to be validated.  Both are relatively close to the right edge of the window, so long error messages would likely be cropped.  And notice that the second TextBox has a Browse button that I don't want hidden in the event of an error.\n\nSo here's what a validation error looks like using my implementation.\n\n\n\nFunctionally, it is very similar to Fredrik's implementation.  If the TextBox has focus, the error will be visible.  Once it loses focus, the error disappears.  If the user hovers the mouse over the toolTipCorner, the error will appear regardless of whether the TextBox has focus or not.  There are a few cosmetic changes as well, such as the toolTipCorner being 50% larger (9 pixels vs. 6 pixels).\n\nThe obvious difference, of course, is that my implementation uses a Popup to display the error.  This solves the first shortcoming because the Popup displays its contents in its own window, so it is not constrained by the dialog's borders.  However, using a Popup did present a couple challenges to overcome.\n\n\nIt appears from testing and online discussions that the Popup is considered a topmost window.  So even when my application was hidden by another application, the Popup was still visible.  This was less-than-desirable behavior.\nThe other gotcha was that if the user happened to move or resize the dialog box while the Popup was visible, the Popup did not reposition itself to maintain its position relative to the invalid control.\n\n\nFortunately, both of these challenges have been addressed.\n\nHere's the code.

    "body": "\n                \nSo i have been trying to find some information about how bad it is not to fix a renderflex error. I have a custom app bar which changes based on the screensize.\nThe searchbutton is an animated container in a row, which is stacked on top of a row which holds the appbar title and some buttons for in between the app bar title and the search button.\nThe problem is that when I resize the window on desktop or web, the search bar (which is based on screenwidth - ktoolbarheight *2) will not immediatly change its size causing the last button (which comes after the search bar) to go out of bounds and cause a renderflex error.\nIve tried several approaches to solve it, including wrapping the row in SingleChildScrollView, but it wont fix the problem. But when I run flutter --release, it doesn't actually give an error. It just has a short delay on resizing the search bar.\nIs it necessary to remove all render flex errors, or is it okay to leave in some (one in my case) as long as they don't break the app functionality? I've tried to find info on this online but i've only found ways to fix the error (which didn't actually fix my specific error).\n    ",

Specifically, the implementation ignores all SSL certificate validation errors, making your app vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks. An attacker could change the affected WebView's content, read transmitted data (such as login credentials), and execute code inside the app using JavaScript.\nTo properly handle SSL certificate validation, change your code to invoke SslErrorHandler.proceed() whenever the certificate presented by the server meets your expectations, and invoke SslErrorHandler.cancel() otherwise. An email alert containing the affected app(s) and class(es) has been sent to your developer account address.\nPlease address this vulnerability as soon as possible and increment the version number of the upgraded APK. For more information about the SSL error handler, please see our documentation in the Developer Help Center. For other technical questions, you can post to https://www.stackoverflow.com/questions and use the tags “android-security” and “SslErrorHandler.” If you are using a 3rd party library that’s responsible for this, please notify the 3rd party and work with them to address the issue.\nTo confirm that you've upgraded correctly, upload the updated version to the Developer Console and check back after five hours. If the app hasn't been correctly upgraded, we will display a warning.\nPlease note, while these specific issues may not affect every app that uses WebView SSL, it's best to stay up to date on all security patches. Apps with vulnerabilities that expose users to risk of compromise may be considered dangerous products in violation of the Content Policy and section 4.4 of the Developer Distribution Agreement.\nPlease ensure all apps published are compliant with the Developer Distribution Agreement and Content Policy. If you have questions or concerns, please contact our support team through the Google Play Developer Help Center.\n\nIf I remove onReceivedSslError (handler.proceed()), then page won't open.\nIs there any way I can open the page in WebView and avoid security alert?\n    ",

Specifically, the\n  implementation ignores all SSL certificate validation errors when\n  establishing an HTTPS connection to a remote host, thereby making your\n  app vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks. An attacker could read\n  transmitted data (such as login credentials) and even change the data\n  transmitted on the HTTPS connection. If you have more than 20 affected\n  apps in your account, please check the Developer Console for a full\n  list.\n  \n  To properly handle SSL certificate validation, change your code in the\n  checkServerTrusted method of your custom X509TrustManager interface to\n  raise either CertificateException or IllegalArgumentException whenever\n  the certificate presented by the server does not meet your\n  expectations. For technical questions, you can post to Stack Overflow\n  and use the tags “android-security” and “TrustManager.”\n  \n  Please address this issue as soon as possible and increment the\n  version number of the upgraded APK. Beginning May 17, 2016, Google\n  Play will block publishing of any new apps or updates containing the\n  unsafe implementation of the interface X509TrustManager.\n  \n  To confirm you’ve made the correct changes, submit the updated version\n  of your app to the Developer Console and check back after five hours.\n  If the app hasn’t been correctly upgraded, we will display a warning.\n  \n  While these specific issues may not affect every app with the\n  TrustManager implementation, it’s best not to ignore SSL certificate\n  validation errors.

I want to make error message more specific. Like:\n\n=====Logo error====Codeigniter uploading error message for logo\n\n=====Background error====Codeigniter uploading error message for background\n\nAs both of the files are uploading in the same form the display_errors() method return all the file uploaded error messages as combined. I tried to keep the errors at variable when logo upload error occurred. Then add just only the background error messages with that variable. But when adding the background error calling the method display_errors(), it return not only the background error but also the logo uploading error. It may be possible by clearing the display_errors() methods return value after the logo errors. But is it possible with codeigniter? Or how to get my desired output. Thanks. \n    ",

Or better yet if there is a way to fix this without having to modify the database, even better!\n\nI'm also not sure how to write it so that it would loop through my database tables and replace all ENUM colum_types with a VARCHAR.\n\nReferences\n\n\nhttps://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8994/tickets/997-dbschemadump-saves-enum-columns-as-varchar0-on-mysql\nhttp://dev.rubyonrails.org/ticket/2832\n\n    ",

            "body": "\nI was also looking for a solution to fix the schema.rb file for enums too, since RoR (version 3.1.3 at the moment) calls them string with limit 0.\n\nIt looks like there's a plugin/gem for handling enum types without changing the database.  On Rails 1 and 2 a plugin: http://enum-column.rubyforge.org/\nOn Rails 3 there's a gem similar to that one:  https://github.com/electronick/enum_column\n\nAfter you add enum_column3 to your Gemfile (and run bundle update), or install the plugin, then run the rake task db:schema:dump to regenerate the schema.rb file.\n\nThe only downside of this plugin/gem that I see is you have to change code in your app that uses those fields (so you have to find it all) from strings to symbols, and the validates_inclusion_of to validates_columns.  Still, it didn't take me too long to do this with grep and vi.\n\nAlternatively you could do as Robert said above and alter the MySQL directly so it matches what RoR expects.  But I personally prefer to keep using Enum types. (I have a LAMP background.)  Treating enum as a varchar, using validates_inclusion_of in the model, works great for everything that doesn't use schema.rb.  Just tests and migrations have a problem.\n\nOr alternatively, you could keep manually editing the schema.rb file to fix the limit. (That's what we've been doing so far, but it's annoying.)\n\n(I guess I don't have enough rep points to add comments? Steve's answer irks me.  You definitely DO want to use migrations, because then you guarantee doing the same alterations on dev as you do in production.  It's too easy to make a mistake even in copy-paste of the SQL during deployment.  Believe me, I know this by experience.  Plus the migrations are a standard place to keep the alterations. And you might need to re-apply them if you restore from an older backup.)\n    ",

Without using OpenMP, it works perfectly. But when I used gcc to compile with the following commands (with -fopenmp added) , which works on our server,\n\ngcc -c -Wall -ansi -I/usr/include -L/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-redhat-linux/4.4.4/ -lgomp -fopenmp test2.c -o test2.o\ngcc -L/usr/lib64/  test2.o -L/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-redhat-linux/4.4.4/ -lgomp -fopenmp -lgsl -lgslcblas -lm -o test2.out\n\n\nI got the following error message:\n\ntest2.c: In function 'main':\ntest2.c:85: internal compiler error: Segmentation fault\nPlease submit a full bug report,\nwith preprocessed source if appropriate.\nSee <http://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla> for instructions.\nPreprocessed source stored into /tmp/ccAGFe3v.out file, please attach this to your bugreport.\nmake: *** [test2.o] Error 1\n\n\nSince I couldn't compile it and the error message shown above was so limited, I'd really like to know what's wrong, so I decompose the subroutine VEGAS_integration_routine I called and then to run it line by line. What I found is that the compilation stopped at its second line\n\ngsl_monte_function Function = { function, 2, 0 };\n\n\nwhich made me so confused. Can't I declare a GSL function in a loop when using OpenMP to flatten the loop? Is there an internal conflict between GSL and OpenMP? I did search on Stack Overflow as well as Google, but it seems that no related post exists (so odd!).I would really appreciate if anyone could either explain what's going on here, or point out an alternative way to do parallel computing. I'm sure the way I wrote my for loop wasn't the best and the neatest...\n    ",

I save the program and open it back up and all of a sudden the compiler is not breaking on an error. In fact, it's not breaking at all!! I'll put a break at the head of the sub (and the next three lines for good measure) and it just does not happen. I thought maybe the events weren't enabled... So, I've put a message box as one of the first lines of code. The message box pops up.... even with the break on it's line.\n\nThis happened once before on a particular line of another macro and I tried copying everything into a .txt file and pasting it back into an earlier version of my program. This worked for months, but the problem now came back. \n\nThe coding isn't really important but I'll paste it below for kicks and giggles. It's aborting without an error wether I remove all the \"on error\"'s or not. I've cut and pasted the code into a new sub and it works fine.

It seems like a utility I might use in the future, and it really bothers me I can't use a user function in a conditional format.

Unfortunately, simply saying ALTER TABLE parent DROP PRIMARY KEY doesn't work:\n\n\n  Error Code : 1025\n  \n  Error on rename of './data/#sql-4013_70f5e' to './data/parent' (errno: 150)\n\n\nSome googling suggests that this is due to the existing foreign key reference from child.  In essence, I need a way to tell MySQL \"use this other column as the primary key, but don't forget the unique-key-ness of the original one\".  Is there any way to accomplish this, other than just dropping the key constraints from child and reinstating them afterwards?  \n\nAssume that I must alter the tables in place, rather than creating copies with the same data and swapping them in later.

library =====================================================\nThe following assertion was thrown during layout:\nA RenderFlex overflowed by 99781 pixels on the bottom.\n\nThe relevant error-causing widget was: \n  Column Column:file:///C:/Users/Vedant/StudioProjects/activepeers_app_internship/lib/introduction/introPage.dart:32:16\nThe overflowing RenderFlex has an orientation of Axis.vertical.\nThe edge of the RenderFlex that is overflowing has been marked in the rendering with a yellow and black striped pattern. This is usually caused by the contents being too big for the RenderFlex.\n\nConsider applying a flex factor (e.g. using an Expanded widget) to force the children of the RenderFlex to fit within the available space instead of being sized to their natural size.\nThis is considered an error condition because it indicates that there is content that cannot be seen. If the content is legitimately bigger than the available space, consider clipping it with a ClipRect widget before putting it in the flex, or using a scrollable container rather than a Flex, like a ListView.\n\nThe specific RenderFlex in question is: RenderFlex#5298b relayoutBoundary=up2 OVERFLOWING\n...  needs compositing\n...  parentData: offset=Offset(0.0, 0.0) (can use size)\n...  constraints: BoxConstraints(0.0<=w<=392.7, 0.0<=h<=803.6)\n...  size: Size(392.7, 803.6)\n...  direction: vertical\n...  mainAxisAlignment: start\n...  mainAxisSize: max\n...  crossAxisAlignment: center\n...  verticalDirection: down\n◢◤◢◤◢◤◢◤◢◤◢◤◢◤◢◤◢◤◢◤◢◤◢◤◢◤◢◤◢◤◢◤◢◤◢◤◢◤◢◤◢◤◢◤◢◤◢◤◢◤◢◤◢◤◢◤◢◤◢◤◢◤◢◤◢◤◢◤◢◤◢◤◢◤◢◤◢◤◢◤◢◤◢◤◢◤◢◤◢◤◢◤◢◤◢◤◢◤◢◤\n====================================================================================================\nReloaded 19 of 804 libraries in 1,051ms.\n\nSo since it said type 'int' in not a subset of type 'double' I changed the variables to num but still this error is coming.\nThis is my code-\nimport 'package:flutter/material.dart';\nimport 'package:activepeers_app_internship/quizScreens/quiz_screen.dart';\n\nclass IntroPage extends StatefulWidget {\n  const IntroPage({Key? key}) : super(key: key);\n\n  @override\n  State<IntroPage> createState() => _IntroPageState();\n}\n\nclass _IntroPageState extends State<IntroPage> {\n  \n\n  @override\n  Widget build(BuildContext context) {\n    return Scaffold(\n\n      body:\n      Center(\n        child: Column(\n          children: [\n            SizedBox(\n              height: 70,\n            ),\n            Padding(padding: EdgeInsets.all(16),\n                child: Image.asset(\"assets/logo3.png\", fit: BoxFit.cover)),\n            SizedBox(\n              height: 70,\n            ),\n            Text(\n              \"Introduction\",\n              style: TextStyle(\n                fontSize: 32,\n                fontWeight: FontWeight.bold,\n              ),\n            ),\n            SizedBox(\n              height: 20,\n            ),\n            Text(\"Take a couple minutes to\\n    introduce yourselves.\",\n              style: TextStyle(\n                fontSize: 26,\n              ),\n            ),\n            SizedBox(\n              height: 70,\n            ),\n            TweenAnimationBuilder(\n              tween: Tween(begin: 120.0, end: 0),\n              duration: Duration(seconds: 120),\n              builder: (context, value, child) {\n                num val = value as double;\n                num time = val;\n                num min = (time/60).floor();\n                num sec = (time%60).floor();\n                return Text(\n                  sec>=0 && sec<10?\"$min:0$sec\":\"$min:$sec\",\n                  style: TextStyle(\n                  fontSize: 80,\n                  fontWeight: FontWeight.bold,\n                ),\n                );\n              },\n              onEnd: () {\n               print('all done');\n              },\n            ),\n            SizedBox(\n              height: 70,\n            ),\n            ElevatedButton(\n                style: ElevatedButton.styleFrom(\n                    primary: Color(0xff16A085),\n                    padding:\n                    EdgeInsets.symmetric(horizontal: 50, vertical: 20),\n                    textStyle:\n                    TextStyle(fontSize: 30, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold)),\n                onPressed: () {Navigator.push(\n                  context,\n                  MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => QuizScreen()),\n                );},\n                child: Text(\n                  \"Ready now!

    "body": "\n                \nI got an email from Google with the following subject : Google Play Warning: SSL Error Handler Vulnerability\". In this email, Google explains that my app has an [\"unsafe implementation of the WebViewClient.onReceivedSslError handler\"\n\nHere's my implementation of the method (WebView Client) :\n\n public class MyBrowser extends WebViewClient {\n    boolean timeout;\n    public MyBrowser() {\n        timeout = true;\n    }\n    @Override\n    public void onPageStarted(WebView view, String url, Bitmap favicon) {\n        try {\n\n                progressBar.setVisibility(View.VISIBLE);                   \n\n        }catch(Exception e){\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        }\n    }\n    @Override\n    public boolean shouldOverrideUrlLoading(WebView view, String url) {\n        view.loadUrl(url);\n        return true;\n    }\n\n    public void onPageFinished(WebView view, String url) {\n\n        try{\n\n        progressBar.setVisibility(View.GONE);\n        webView.setVisibility(View.VISIBLE);\n\n        }catch(Exception e){\n            Log.e(\"Exception\", e.toString());\n            Crashlytics.logException(e);\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void onReceivedError(WebView view, int errorCode,\n                                String description, String failingUrl) {\n        isBack=true;\n        if (!CommonUtility.isNetworkAvailable()) {\n\n            view.loadUrl(\"file:///android_asset/error.html\");\n        }\n    }\n\n}\n\n\nAfter first warning, i removed the onReceivedSslError Method from the WebClient and uploaded the new build, but again i got the same warning from Google Play.\nand they recommended me to :-\n\" It looks like Version 18 still has the vulnerability. Please re-check your app's manifest file, this time more carefully, to ensure that the vulnerability has been address.\"\n\nHere's my Manifest File :- (Kindly Help me to get rid off this

Specifically, the implementation ignores all SSL certificate validation errors, making your app vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks. An attacker could change the affected WebView's content, read transmitted data (such as login credentials), and execute code inside the app using JavaScript.\nTo properly handle SSL certificate validation, change your code to invoke SslErrorHandler.proceed() whenever the certificate presented by the server meets your expectations, and invoke SslErrorHandler.cancel() otherwise. An email alert containing the affected app(s) and class(es) has been sent to your developer account address.\nPlease address this vulnerability as soon as possible and increment the version number of the upgraded APK. For more information about the SSL error handler, please see our documentation in the Developer Help Center. For other technical questions, you can post to https://www.stackoverflow.com/questions and use the tags “android-security” and “SslErrorHandler.” If you are using a 3rd party library that’s responsible for this, please notify the 3rd party and work with them to address the issue.\nTo confirm that you've upgraded correctly, upload the updated version to the Developer Console and check back after five hours. If the app hasn't been correctly upgraded, we will display a warning.\nPlease note, while these specific issues may not affect every app that uses WebView SSL, it's best to stay up to date on all security patches. Apps with vulnerabilities that expose users to risk of compromise may be considered in violation of our Malicious Behavior policy and section 4.4 of the Developer Distribution Agreement.\nPlease ensure all apps published are compliant with the Developer Distribution Agreement and Developer Program Policies.

I am working in Python 3.6.\n\nIn the case where the call is successful, I am able to simply assign the call directly to a variable and get back the object returned.\n\nFor example:\n\ntry:\n   data = block_io.withdraw_from_labels(amounts='AMOUNT1,AMOUNT2,...', from_labels='LABEL1,LABEL2,...', to_addresses='ADDRESS1,ADDRESS2,...')\n   print(data)\n\n\nif successful would return this:\n\n{\n  \"status\" : \"success\",\n  \"data\" : {\n    \"reference_id\" : \"<data>\",\n    \"more_signatures_needed\" : true,\n    \"inputs\" : [\n      {\n        \"input_no\" : 0,\n        \"signatures_needed\" : 1,\n        \"data_to_sign\" : \"<data>\",\n        \"signers\" : [\n          {\n            \"signer_address\" : \"<data>\",\n            \"signer_public_key\" : \"<data>\",\n            \"signed_data\" : null\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    ],\n    \"encrypted_passphrase\" : {\n      \"signer_address\" : \"<data>\",\n      \"signer_public_key\" : \"<data>\",\n      \"passphrase\" : \"<data>\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\nbut if not successful would move on the except case\n\nexcept Exception as myVariable:\n   print(myVariable)\n\n\nand return this:\n\n'Cannot withdraw funds without Network Fee of 0.00000000 DOGE. Maximum withdrawable balance is 0.00000000 DOGE.'\n\n\n\n\nThe Challenge\n\nThat last message was taken directly from \"status\": \"fail\" object that looks like the following. I can get this full object by doing the API call as a cURL instead of using their Python API docs. The object looks like:\n\n{\n  \"status\" : \"fail\",\n  \"data\" : {\n    \"error_message\" : \"Cannot withdraw funds without Network Fee of 0.00000000 DOGE. Maximum withdrawable balance is 0.00000000 DOGE.\",\n    \"available_balance\" : \"0.00000000\",\n    \"max_withdrawal_available\" : \"0.00000000\",\n    \"minimum_balance_needed\" : \"10.00000000\",\n    \"estimated_network_fee\" : \"0.00000000\"\n  }\n}\n\n\nThe problem is that:\n\nexcept Exception as myVariable:\n\n\nonly assigns the value from the \"error_message\" key to myVariable.\n\nMy question is, how can I access the other keys within that object given that I can't seem to assign the results of that call within python in the case of a failure (i.e. data = <pythonic api call> won't work), and within except I can only seem to access the value from  the \"error_message\" key?\n\nIdeally, I would like to access the entire object under the \"status: \"fail\" scenario somehow.\n\n(p.s. entire project on Github here.)\n    ",

    "body": "\n                \nHello I am using a System.Windows.Forms.FolderBrowserDialog in my WPF application to select folders in users computer. The selected folder is displayed in a TextBox and also is validated in the view model.\n\nI am trying to display invalid folder Error Template message below the TextBox for the following scenario:\n\n\nIf the folder does not exist and not accessible.\nif the user selects a folder that is a system folder. For this example, I hard coded the value as @\"c:\\windows\\boot\". \n\n\nWhat I am noticing is: If I type a folder that does not exist, I will get the binding exception which allows me to set the error template.\n\nBut if I select a drive that the user does not have access or I select the @\"c:\\windows\\boot\" I will get an exception that is either caught at the App.xaml unhandle exception or if u have a try catch (where the folder is set) it will be caught there. How can I have this as a binding exception? Before I decide to just leave it as a try catch I wanted to understand if there is anyway I can have it as a binding exception (which saves a click!). \n\nHere is the code:\n\npublic class MainWindowViewModel : INotifyPropertyChanged\n    {\n        public MainWindowViewModel()\n        {\n        }\n\n        private string _folderName;\n        public string FolderName\n        {\n            get { return _folderName; }\n            set\n            {\n                _folderName = value;\n\n                if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(_folderName))\n                    InvalidValidFolder();\n\n                if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(_folderName))\n                    ValidateFolder();\n\n                OnPropertyChanged(\"FolderName\");\n            }\n        }\n\n        private void ValidateFolder()\n        {\n            if (!Directory.Exists(FolderName))\n                throw new Exception(\"Folder does not exist\");\n        }\n\n        private void InvalidValidFolder()\n        {\n            if (FolderName.ToLower() == @\"c:\\windows\\boot\")\n                throw new Exception(\"This folder is restricted.\");\n        }\n\n        public event PropertyChangedEventHandler PropertyChanged;\n\n        public void OnPropertyChanged(string propertyName)\n        {\n            PropertyChangedEventHandler handler = PropertyChanged;\n            if (handler != null)\n            {\n                handler(this, new PropertyChangedEventArgs(propertyName));\n            }\n        }\n\n    }\n\n\nI just have MainWindow and MainWindowViewModel. \n\n<DockPanel>\n        <Grid DockPanel.Dock=\"Top\" Width=\"Auto\" Margin=\"50\">\n            <Grid.ColumnDefinitions>\n                <ColumnDefinition Width=\"*\"/>\n                <ColumnDefinition Width=\"Auto\" />\n            </Grid.ColumnDefinitions>\n            <TextBox x:Name=\"textBox\" Text=\"{Binding FolderName, ValidatesOnExceptions=True, ValidatesOnDataErrors=True}\" Margin=\"0,0,0,5\" Grid.Column=\"0\" />\n            <Button Grid.Column=\"1\"\n                        Margin=\"5,0,5,0\"\n                        Width=\"35\"\n                        Content=\"...\"\n                        Click=\"LocationChoose_Click\"/>\n        </Grid>\n        <Grid></Grid>\n    </DockPanel>\n\n\nCodebehind\n\npublic partial class MainWindow : Window\n    {\n        public MainWindowViewModel ViewModel {get; set;}\n        public MainWindow()\n        {\n            InitializeComponent();\n            this.DataContext = ViewModel = new MainWindowViewModel();\n        }\n\n        private void LocationChoose_Click(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)\n        {\n            try\n            {\n                FolderBrowserDialog folderDlg = new FolderBrowserDialog();\n                folderDlg.ShowDialog();\n                ViewModel.FolderName = folderDlg.SelectedPath;\n\n            }\n            catch (Exception ex)\n            {\n                System.Windows.MessageBox.Show(ex.Message);\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    ",

I suspect it is for the reasons discussed here:\n\nValidation ErrorTemplate not showing on data errors\n\nBut the fix for this problem doesn't seem to work for me because I'm not using a control template around my content presenter.  When I wrap an AdornmentDecorator tag around my content presenter, it doesn't seem to fix the problem.  It DOES work if I put an AdornmentDecorator inside each control I load into the contentpresenter (as the root element), but I'd like to avoid this repetition if possible.\n\nAny insights?\n\nUPDATE\n\nI tried this approach suggested by Dennis, but to no avail.  The control binds okay, but it works no better than the current approach (also shown commented below). Note: I tried it both with the AdornerDecorator as a singleton element the way Dennis has it, and surrounding the ContentPresenter, as shown below.  Neither show any difference - the adorners around my controls all disappear when the MainControl binding is changed.\n\n<UserControl.Resources>\n    <Style x:Key=\"MainContentControl\" TargetType=\"{x:Type ContentControl}\">\n        <Setter Property=\"Template\">\n            <Setter.Value>\n                <ControlTemplate TargetType=\"{x:Type ContentControl}\">\n                    <Grid>\n                        <AdornerDecorator>\n                            <ContentPresenter Content=\"{Binding MainControl}\"/>\n                        </AdornerDecorator>\n                    </Grid>\n                </ControlTemplate>\n            </Setter.Value>\n        </Setter>\n    </Style>\n\n</UserControl.Resources>\n<Grid>\n\n     .....\n\n\n    <ScrollViewer Grid.Column=\"2\" x:Name=\"StepScrollViewer\">\n        <StackPanel Margin=\"20,20,20,500\" >\n            <ContentControl Style=\"{StaticResource MainContentControl}\"/>\n        </StackPanel>\n    </ScrollViewer>\n\n    <!-- THE BELOW WORKS IF I SURROUND EACH BOUND CONTROL WITH adornerdecorator -->\n    <ScrollViewer Grid.Column=\"2\" x:Name=\"StepScrollViewer\">\n        <StackPanel Margin=\"20,20,20,500\">\n            <ContentPresenter Content=\"{Binding MainControl}\"/>\n        </StackPanel>\n    </ScrollViewer>\n    -->\n\n    ",

So the error-message cannot be shown in the tooltip of the combobox - unless I find a way to combine the two without having to resolve it locally (I want that code in my resourcedictionary).\n\nI also do not want the \"forbidden sign\" to handle mouse clicks (it gobbles up the click and prevent the combobox from dropping down, if the user clicks on the \"forbidden sign\".\n\nI tried setting IsHitTestVisible to false on the grid and on the border inside the ErrorTemplate, but that caused the Tooltip to never show.\nI also tried setting IsEnabled to false on the same two constrols, but that would not send the mouseclick on to the combobox itself (the list in the combobox does not drop down).\n\nIs there any way to do this directly in the combobox-style or errortemplate? I do not even mind having a code behind - but I really do not want to add code locally where the combobox-style is used.\n    ",

Make sure you get the C:\\Documents and Settings\\All Users\\Application Data\\MySQL\\mysql directory.

It's doable, see: http://gusiev.com/2009/04/update-and-create-timestamps-with-mysql/.\n\nAs a first step, I copied the example table from the reference site and modeled it in Workbench. I then did a forward engineer and tested the resulting SQL in phpMyAdmin. Everything worked. Here was the SQL:\n\n-- -----------------------------------------------------\n-- Table `test_table`\n-- -----------------------------------------------------\n\nDROP TABLE IF EXISTS `test_table` ;\n\nCREATE  TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `test_table` (\n  `id` INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT ,\n  `stamp_created` TIMESTAMP NULL DEFAULT '0000-00-00 00:00:00' ,\n  `stamp_updated` TIMESTAMP NULL DEFAULT now() on update now() ,\n  PRIMARY KEY (`id`) )\nENGINE = InnoDB;\n\n\nAfter verifying that the idea works, I then implemented the concept in one of my actual tables. The resulting SQL was this:\n\n-- -----------------------------------------------------\n-- Table `user_login`\n-- -----------------------------------------------------\n\nDROP TABLE IF EXISTS `user_login` ;\n\nCREATE  TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `user_login` (\n  `user_login_id` INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT ,\n  `user_id` INT NOT NULL ,\n  `hashed_password` CHAR(255) NULL ,\n  `provider_id` CHAR(255) NULL ,\n  `provider_name` CHAR(255) NULL ,\n  `unverified_email_address` CHAR(255) NULL ,\n  `verification_code_email_address` CHAR(255) NULL ,\n  `verification_code_password_change` CHAR(255) NULL ,\n  `verified_email_address` CHAR(255) NULL ,\n  `stamp_created` TIMESTAMP NULL DEFAULT '0000-00-00 00:00:00' ,\n  `stamp_updated` TIMESTAMP NULL DEFAULT now() on update now() ,\n  `stamp_deleted` TIMESTAMP NULL ,\n  PRIMARY KEY (`user_login_id`) ,\n  INDEX `user_login_user_id` (`user_id` ASC) ,\n  UNIQUE INDEX `verified_email_address_UNIQUE` (`verified_email_address` ASC) ,\n  UNIQUE INDEX `unverified_email_address_UNIQUE` (`unverified_email_address` ASC) ,\n  CONSTRAINT `user_login_user_id`\n    FOREIGN KEY (`user_id` )\n    REFERENCES `user` (`user_id` )\n    ON DELETE NO ACTION\n    ON UPDATE NO ACTION)\nENGINE = InnoDB;\n\n\nWhen I execute the SQL, I get the following error:\n\n#1067 - Invalid default value for 'stamp_created'\n\nAnyone see what's causing my problem?\n    ",

    "title": "expecting EOF, found '<something>'",
    "body": "\n                \nMy 1st post here so I'll try to keep it simple. I'm trying to create a plot of some mass spectrometry data using Processing. I wanted to write a sketch to parse data from pseudo-XML into tables and then to plot this data as points on 2 axes (time, mz) with the third axis, the signal, as the colour of the point.\n\nAt this stage I want the plot to be the dimensions of the data. In my test data this is 38 time points on the x axis, 51 mz points on the Y and signal ranging from 0 to 12,000. The bounds of a real data set will be a hundred times bigger in every dimension. \n\nMy issue is that the width and height of the plot is dependent on the data and establishing these limits involves a bit of code. In Processing you can only call size() immediately after void setup() so I put all the calculation code first. This threw the title error. I couldn't work around it so I output the data to three csv files and started on a 2nd sketch to import that data and plot it. I've run into the same error. \n\nThe exact error is expecting EOF, found '', where  can be the first word on a line. It has been for, mzTable and if, depending on the code I've tried.\n\nHere's the second sketch in full:\n\nimport java.io.*;\n\nint debug = 1;\n\nString target = \"M1A crop.txt\";  // test data\n\n\nFile file = new File(target);\n\n// ~  ~  ~  \n\nString folderPath = file.getParent(); // target folder path\nString name = file.getName(); \n\nString mzData = folderPath + \"\\\\\" + name + \" - mz data.csv\" ;    // CSV file to open\nString signalData = folderPath + \"\\\\\" + name + \" - signal data.csv\" ;    // CSV file to open\nString summaryData = folderPath + \"\\\\\" + name + \" - summary data.csv\" ;    // CSV file to open\n\nTable mzTable = new Table();\nTable signalTable = new Table();\nTable summaryTable = new Table();\n\nmzTable = loadTable(mzData, \"header\");\nsignalTable = loadTable(signalData, \"header\");\nsummaryTable = loadTable(summaryData, \"header\");\n\nint timeMin = summaryTable.getInt(0, \"timeMin\");\nint timeMax = summaryTable.getInt(0, \"timeMax\");\nint mzMin = summaryTable.getInt(0, \"mzMin\");\nint mzMax = summaryTable.getInt(0, \"mzMax\");\nint signalMin = summaryTable.getInt(0, \"signalMin\");\nint signalMax = summaryTable.getInt(0, \"signalMax\");\n\nwidth = mzTable.getColumnCount();  // this is the number of time points on the X axis\nheight = mzMax - mzMin;  // this is the number of mz points on the Y axis\n\nprintln(\"time Min: \" + timeMin + \", Max: \" + timeMax);\nprintln(\"mz Min: \" + mzMin + \", Max: \" + mzMax);\nprintln(\"signal Min: \" + signalMin + \", Max: \" + signalMax);\n\n\nvoid setup() {\n  size(width, height);\n\n}    // end of void setup()\n\n\nvoid draw() {\n  for(int x = 0; x < height; x++) {\n    for(int y = 0; y < width; y++) {\n      stroke(map(signalTable.getInt(x, y), signalMin, signalMax, 0, 255));\n      point(x, y);\n    }\n  }  \n}\n\n\nThe source of the error is identified as coming from line 19: \n\nmzTable = loadTable(mzData, \"header\");\n\n\nI'm no hacker but I can see there's nothing wrong with that code. If I comment out everything from void setup() onwards the code runs so its something to do with having the import and summary code outside of that function. If I put bad code in front of it, such as just for( then I get expecting EOF, found 'for'. Can anyone tell me why? \n\nMany thanks in advance, \n\nChris\n\nedited for derp 20:20 1-5-15\n\nedit 22:00 1-5-15\nI've just tried the sketch in Processing 3.0a7, which has much better error reporting. It has identified a different error with line 19: Syntax error on tokens, delete these tokens. Searching for this error lead me to this questions with suggestions of a diagnosis. \nSyntax error on tokens, delete these tokens\n    ",

    "title": "Internal Compiler Error on Array Value-Initialization in VC++14 (VS2015)",
    "body": "\n                \nI'm getting an ICE on Visual Studio 2015 CTP 6. Unfortunately, this is happening in a large project, and I can't post the whole code here, and I have been unable to reproduce the problem on a minimal sample. What I'm hoping to get is help in constructing such a sample (to submit to Microsoft) or possibly illumination regarding what's happening and/or what I'm doing wrong.\n\nThis is a mock-up of what I'm doing. (Note that the code I'm presenting here does NOT generate an ICE; I'm merely using this simple example to explain the situation.)\n\nI have a class A which is not copyable (it has a couple of \"reference\" members) and doesn't have a default constructor. Another class, B holds an array of As (plain C array of A values, no references/pointers) and I'm initializing this array in the constructor of B using uniform initialization syntax. See the sample code below.\n\nstruct B;\n\nstruct A\n{\n    int & x;\n    B * b;\n\n    A (B * b_, int & x_) : x (x_), b (b_) {}\n    A (A const &) = delete;\n    A & operator = (A const &) = delete;\n};\n\nstruct B\n{\n    A a [3];\n    int foo;\n\n    B ()\n        : a {{this,foo},{this,foo},{nullptr,foo}}  // <-- THE CULPRIT!\n        , foo (2)\n    {  // <-- This is where the compiler says the error occurs\n    }\n};\n\nint main ()\n{\n    B b;\n    return 0;\n}\n\n\nI can't use std::array because I need to construct the elements in their final place (can't copy.) I can't use std::vector because I need B to contain the As.\n\nNote that if I don't use an array and use individual variables (e.g. A a0, a1, a2;, which I can do because the array is small and fixed in size) the ICE goes away. But this is not what I want since I'll lose ability to get to them by index, which I need. I can use a union of the loose variables over the array to solve my ICE problem and get indexing (construct using the variables, access using the array,) but I think that would result in \"undefined behavior\" and seems convoluted.\n\nThe obvious differences between the above sample and my actual code (aside from the scale) is that A and B are classes instead of structs, each is declared/defined in its own source/header file pair, and none of the constructors is inline. (I duplicated these and still couldn't reproduce the ICE.)\n\nFor my actual project, I've tried cleaning the built files and rebuild, to no avail. Any suggestions, etc.?\n\nP.S. I'm not sure if my title is suitable. Any suggestions on that?!?!\n\nUPDATE 1: This is the compiler file referenced in the C1001 fatal error message: (compiler file 'f:\\dd\\vctools\\compiler\\utc\\src\\p2\\main.c', line 230).\n\nUPDATE 2: Since I had forgotten to mention, the codebase compiles cleanly (and correctly) under GCC 4.9.2 in C++14 mode.\n\nAlso, I'm compiling with all optimizations disabled.\n\nUPDATE 3: I have found out that if I rearrange the member data in B and put the array at the very end, the code compiles. I've tried several other permutations and it sometimes does compile and sometimes doesn't. I can't see any patterns regarding what other members coming before the array make the compiler go full ICE! (being UDTs or primitives, having constructors or not, POD or not, reference or pointer or value type, ...)\n\nThis means that I have sort of a solution for my problem, although my internal class layout is important to me and this application, I can tolerate the performance hit (due to cache misses resulting from putting some hot data apart from the rest) in order to get past this thing.\n\nHowever, I still really like a minimal repro of the ICE to be able to submit to Microsoft. I don't want to be stuck with this for the next two years (at least!)\n\nUPDATE 4: I have tried VS2015 RC and the ICE is still there (although the error message refers to a different internal line of code, line 247 in the same \"main.c\" file.)\n\nAnd I have opened a bug report on Microsoft Connect.\n    ",

I have been receiving: \n\n\n  error C1001: An internal error has occurred in the compiler.  \n\n\nwith the location\n\n\n  compiler file 'f:\\dd\\vctools\\compiler\\cxxfe\\sl\\p1\\c\\cast.c', line 725\n\n\nThe MCVE below triggers this ICE, even under /Od:\n\n#include <utility>\n#include <type_traits>\n\ntemplate <typename Type, typename Arg, typename = void>\nstruct isBraceConsructibleImpl\n    : public std::false_type{};\n\ntemplate <typename Type, typename Arg>\nstruct isBraceConsructibleImpl<Type, Arg, decltype((void)Type{ std::declval<Arg>() }) >\n    : public std::true_type{};\n\nint main(int, char**){}\n\n\nAs can be seen on coliru, gcc and clang are both fine with this (even under -O2). However, while an ICE is most certainly a bug in MSVC, the acceptance of said code by both gcc and clang is no guarantee that it is valid code in the end.  \n\nRemoving the Arg from the template and replacing the Arg in the declval with int does not reproduce the error:  \n\n#include <utility>\n#include <type_traits>\n\ntemplate <typename Type, typename = void>\nstruct isBraceConsructibleImpl\n    : public std::false_type{};\n\ntemplate <typename Type>\nstruct isBraceConsructibleImpl<Type, decltype((void)Type{ std::declval<int>() }) >\n    : public std::true_type{};\n\nint main(int, char**){}\n\n\nand gcc and clang are once again fine with it.\n\nIs MSVC is producing an ICE from valid code?\n    ",

I can reproduce the issue with only a few lines of code—but I can't find where in my project the error-causing pattern is being used.\n\nMy goal is to figure out which code in my project is causing this bug, and apply a workaround.\n\nIssue & Replication\n\nThe issue is outlined in the JDK-8074381 bug report and can be replicated in only a few lines of code.\n\npublic class Test {\n  public interface Foo<L> extends Function<Number, String> {\n    String apply(Number p);\n  }\n  private static final Foo CRASH = p -> \"This will crash javac 1.8.0_131\";\n}\n\n\nThe issue manifests when using non-parameterized lambda instead of a non-parameterized inner class (which should both be valid according to the language spec I believe). So \n\nprivate static final Foo INNER = new Foo<Object>() {\n  @Override\n  public String apply(final Number p) {\n    return \"This will not crash javac 1.8.0_131\";\n  }\n};\n\n\nworks fine.

Here's what I've tried.\n\n\nMy first thought was to inspect the file that was being compiled when this error occurred. However, I'm unable to figure out how to check which source file was being compiled when the error was encountered. If this is possible, that information would be helpful.\nMy second thought was to do a regex search of all of my code to look for any type parameterized interfaces or interfaces that extend generic interfaces. Neither of these searches yielded code which obviously matches the issue producing code—no unused generics (changing interface Foo<L> to interface Foo in the example would fix the issue). Therefore I think that a more subtle understanding of what inside of the compiler actually causes this bug might be helpful in identifying the piece of code responsible, because it might widen my search criteria. (It's also possible that I'm getting a bug with the exact same stack trace for a completeley different problem, but this seems unlikely to me and I'm not sure where I'd start on that, any ideas?)\n\n\nI think it would be most worthwhile to be able to inspect a compiler log or something to check what was being compiled when this issue popped up. Any ideas?\n\nThanks.\n    ",

See the description of the CREATE TABLE for yout two tables.\n\nIf both tables are empty, drop them and re-create them, choosing InnoDB as engine. You could also add the FOREIGN KEY constraints in the tables creation script(s). \n\n\n\nFrom MySQL Reference Manual:\n\n\n  Foreign keys definitions are subject to the following conditions:\n  \n  \n  Both tables must be InnoDB tables and\n  they must not be TEMPORARY tables.\n  Corresponding columns in the foreign\n  key and the referenced key must have\n  similar internal data types inside\n  InnoDB so that they can be compared\n  without a type conversion. The size\n  and sign of integer types must be the\n  same. The length of string types need\n  not be the same. For nonbinary\n  (character) string columns, the\n  character set and collation must be\n  the same.\n  InnoDB requires indexes on foreign\n  keys and referenced keys so that\n  foreign key checks can be fast and\n  not require a table scan. In the\n  referencing table, there must be an\n  index where the foreign key columns\n  are listed as the first columns in\n  the same order. Such an index is\n  created on the referencing table\n  automatically if it does not exist.\n  (This is in contrast to some older\n  versions, in which indexes had to be\n  created explicitly or the creation of\n  foreign key constraints would fail.)\n  index_name, if given, is used as\n  described previously.\n  InnoDB permits a foreign key to\n  reference any index column or group\n  of columns. However, in the\n  referenced table, there must be an\n  index where the referenced columns\n  are listed as the first columns in\n  the same order.\n  Index prefixes on foreign key columns\n  are not supported. One consequence of\n  this is that BLOB and TEXT columns\n  cannot be included in a foreign key\n  because indexes on those columns must\n  always include a prefix length.\n  If the CONSTRAINT symbol clause is\n  given, the symbol value must be\n  unique in the database. If the clause\n  is not given, InnoDB creates the name\n  automatically.\n  \n\n\n\n\n@egervari: What happens if you run this:\n\nCREATE TABLE `test` (\n  `company_id` bigint(20) NOT NULL,\n  `module_id` bigint(20) NOT NULL,\n\n  KEY  (`module_id`),\n  KEY  (`company_id`),\n\n  CONSTRAINT `test_fk_module`\n    FOREIGN KEY (`module_id`)\n    REFERENCES `module` (`module_id`),\n\n  CONSTRAINT `test_fk_company`\n    FOREIGN KEY (`company_id`)\n    REFERENCES `company` (`company_id`)\n    ON DELETE RESTRICT\n    ON UPDATE RESTRICT\n\n) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8 ;\n\n\n\n\nAnd if you run:\n\nALTER TABLE `company_to_module`\n  ADD CONSTRAINT `company_to_module_fk_company` \n    FOREIGN KEY (`company_id`)\n    REFERENCES `company` (`company_id`)\n    ON DELETE RESTRICT\n    ON UPDATE RESTRICT;\n\n    ",

This is usually caused by the contents being too big for the RenderFlex.\nConsider applying a flex factor (e.g. using an Expanded widget) to force the children of the\nRenderFlex to fit within the available space instead of being sized to their natural size.\nThis is considered an error condition because it indicates that there is content that cannot be\nseen. If the content is legitimately bigger than the available space, consider clipping it with a\nClipRect widget before putting it in the flex, or using a scrollable container rather than a Flex,\nlike a ListView.\nThe specific RenderFlex in question is: RenderFlex#33d4b relayoutBoundary=up2 OVERFLOWING:\nneeds compositing\ncreator: Column ← MediaQuery ← Padding ← SafeArea ← Stack ← LayoutBuilder ← SizedBox ← Center ←\nKeyedSubtree-[GlobalKey#bf933] ← _BodyBuilder ← MediaQuery ← LayoutId-[<_ScaffoldSlot.body>] ← ⋯\nparentData: offset=Offset(0.0, 0.0) (can use size)\nconstraints: BoxConstraints(0.0<=w<=500.0, 0.0<=h<=237.0)\nsize: Size(500.0, 237.0)\ndirection: vertical\n\nI've isolated the issue to my ToDoPage widget, where a Column widget containing several child widgets, including text and images, seems to be the source of the problem.

I've tried wrapping the problematic Column widget in a SingleChildScrollView and using Expanded widgets around my text widgets, but the overflow error persists.\nHere's a snippet of the attempted fix:\nSafeArea(\n  child: Expanded(\n    child: SingleChildScrollView(\n      child: Column(\n        crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.stretch,\n        children: [\n          const SizedBox(height: 20.0),\n         \n        ],\n      ),\n    ),\n  ),\n)\n\n\nAnd for the text widgets:\n\nchild: Flexible(\n  child: Text(\n    'My success list',\n    style: GoogleFonts.nunito(\n      color: Colors.white,\n      fontSize: 30.0,\n      fontWeight: FontWeight.w500,\n    ),\n  ),\n)\n\n\n\n\n\nI've also included custom widgets Glassmorphism and SmileFaceCheckbox in my UI.

All i need is to have the children of the list view have dynamic widths depending on the screen and all fit in it.\nTried to give each container width like this:\nwidth: (MediaQuery.of(context).size.width - 30) / n,\nWhere n is the number of progress indicators to create but it always messes up the design.\n    ",

I have a YoutubePlayerScaffold containing a ListView.separated widget inside a Column. When I wrap the ListView.separated with an Expanded widget to enable scrolling, I can scroll the list, but I encounter a renderflex error when exiting full screen mode (changing screen orientation from landscape to portrait). On the other hand, when I add a SingleChildScrollView around the Column and remove the Expanded widget, the renderflex error on exit full screen is resolved, but I can no longer scroll the list. I'm looking for a solution that allows scrolling in the ListView.separated without encountering renderflex errors on exit full screen.\n    ",

How to debug the error if running flutter code on mobile browser?\n  \nHere is the code that I have:\n void main() async {\n  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();\n  app = await Firebase.initializeApp(\n    options: DefaultFirebaseOptions.currentPlatform,\n  );\n  auth = FirebaseAuth.instanceFor(app: app);\n\n  runApp(const ProviderScope(child: MyApp()));\n}\nclass MyApp extends StatelessWidget {\n  const MyApp({super.key});\n\n  @override\n  Widget build(BuildContext context) {\n    return MaterialApp(\n        title: 'WORDSUITE',\n        theme: ThemeData(\n          primaryColor: const Color(0xffc3e1f3),\n          textTheme: GoogleFonts.interTextTheme(),\n        ),\n        home: const FrontPage(),\n        routes: {\n          '/result': (context) => const ResultScreen(),\n        });\n  }\n}\n\nclass _FrontPageState extends ConsumerState<FrontPage> {\n\n...\n...\n@override\n  Widget build(context) {\n    return Scaffold(\n      backgroundColor: Colors.black54,\n      appBar: const CustomAppBar(),\n      body: (userScore.isInit)\n          ? const Center(child: Loading())\n          : Center(\n              child: Container(\n                width: userScore.boxwidth,\n                alignment: Alignment.center,\n                decoration: const BoxDecoration(color: Color(0xffe5e1da)),\n                child: Column(\n                  mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.start,\n                  crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.center,\n                  children: [\n                    const SizedBox(height: 20),\n                    Consumer(builder: (BuildContext context, WidgetRef ref, _) {\n                      // ignore: prefer_const_constructors\n                      return Hints();\n                    }),\n                    const SizedBox(height: 20),\n                    FittedBox(\n                      child: Row(\n                        mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,\n                        mainAxisSize: MainAxisSize.min,\n                        children: [\n                          const SizedBox(width: 10),\n                          GestureDetector(\n                              onTap: () {\n                                setState(() {\n                                  userScore.setActiveBoxValue(0);\n                                });\n                              },\n                              child: WordBox(\n                                wordList.todaysword?.firstpuzzle ??

One other thing I would like to mention is this. If I resize the window from desktop size to mobile size, the application resizes just fine. However if I set the browser to mobile size using F12 and reload the app, the game does not render (as shown in the second image). I am not getting any error or any overflow of pixels in the debug logs so not getting a clue as to where the renderer is failing\n    ",

How can I know the needed height?\nI couldn't get the height of the widget because of it still building..\nI tried more solutions like:\nExpanded(), Flexable().. but no effect..\nI tried also to wrap that with SingleChildScrollView(), it scrolls now but I lost the callapsing of the SliverAppBar..\nPlease can someone help?\n    ",

    "body": "\n                \nI have two pages in my application. SearchScreen and MovieScreen.\nUser can search movies on the SearchScreen and when he chooses one movie from the search results, the navigation (using go_router package) pushes MovieScreen page for the specific movie (context.push).\nThe MovieScreen page (except other stuff) has a background widget which displays image and certain gradients on the background of the page.\nclass MovieScreenBackground extends StatelessWidget {\n  const MovieScreenBackground({super.key});\n\n  @override\n  Widget build(BuildContext context) {\n    MovieScreenSettings settings =\n        MovieScreenSettingsWrapper.of(context)!.settings;\n    String posterPath = context.select((MovieScreenBloc bloc) =>\n        bloc.state.movieData!.basicData.posterPath.path!);\n    MovieScreenStateColors colors = context.select((MovieScreenBloc bloc) =>\n        bloc.state.colors!);\n    return Stack(\n      children: [\n        SizedBox(\n          height: settings.bgImageHeight,\n          child: Container(\n            decoration: BoxDecoration(\n              image: DecorationImage(\n                image: NetworkImage(posterPath),\n                fit: BoxFit.cover,\n              ),\n            ),\n          ),\n        ),\n        Column(\n          children: [\n            SizedBox(\n              height: settings.bgImageHeight,\n              child: Container(\n                decoration: BoxDecoration(\n                  gradient: LinearGradient(\n                    colors: [\n                      colors.bgTertiaryColor.withOpacity(0.5),\n                      colors.bgPrimaryColor.withOpacity(1.0),\n                    ],\n                    stops: const [0, 1],\n                    begin: Alignment.topCenter,\n                    end: Alignment.bottomCenter,\n                  ),\n                ),\n              ),\n            ),\n            Expanded(\n              child: Container(\n                decoration: BoxDecoration(\n                  gradient: LinearGradient(\n                      colors: [\n                        colors.bgPrimaryColor,\n                        colors.bgPrimaryColor.darken(95)\n                      ],\n                      begin: Alignment.topCenter,\n                      end: Alignment.bottomCenter,\n                      stops: const [0, 1]),\n                ),\n              ),\n            ),\n          ],\n        )\n      ],\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nMy issue is that when going back to the previous page (SearchScreen) using native Android back button or in-app back button (context.pop) I get RenderFlex overflowed error. It reads that source of the error is the Column widget in the MovieScreenBackground class which is pretty weird to me as it shouldn't be rendered going back to previous page. I am pretty certain that the issue is coming from the virtual keyboard popping up when going back to SearchScreen page.\nWhat is also weird is that this error is not noticeable in the app. It only appears in the debug console but doesn't seem to stop or present any bad behaviour in the app itself.\nI tried these solutions:\n\nTried wrapping Column in the SingleChildScrollView. I think this can't work for me, because I need my very bottom Container in the Column to be wrapped in the Expanded widget to take all remaining space on the background.\n\nChanging resizeToAvoidBottomInset property of the Scaffold to false. This gets rid of the RenderFlex overflowed error but it for some reason changes appearing of the popped-up keyboard in a strange way.\n\n\nresizeToAvoidBottomInset = true\nresizeToAvoidBottomInset = false\n\nTried wrapping Column with CustomScrollView along with SliverFillRemaining. This doesn't work.\n\nAre there any other solutions? Or should I just ignore the error as it doesn't cause any noticeable issue in the app (except being showed in the debug console)?\n    ",

        "Not clear what you mean by \"Is that it?\". But the error (i.e. PKIX path building failed: sun.security.provider.certpath.SunCertPathBuilderException: unable to find valid certification path to requested target)  looks familiar. It's usually an indication that your trust store needs to be update with the ca cert of the CA which signed the server certificate for the server you're trying to connect to.",
        "Is there any default path of the certificates? In CentOS, jboss was installed on /usr/local/jboss-4.0.5.GA and there isn't path like \"security\\cacerts\" inside of /bin or something like that.",
        "For now, I tested the Java upgrade on another vm and solved the problem without having to configure the certificates. But anyway, I still wanted to understand how to configure the certificates so that future events don't happen.",
        "The \"certificatepath\" does not refer to the directory path to your certificate, but the path from the server certificate up the chain to all the way to the CA certificate for the server certificate (server cert -> intermediate ca cert -> root ca cert).   So, the cacert needs to be update with the newest CA and Intermediate certificates for the server certificate of the server you are hitting.   I'm guessing that by upgrading the Java Version, you probably upgraded the CACerts and that's why it's working. Another way of fixing it would be to update just the cacerts."

    "title": "AttributeError and RecursionError happened when using `__setattr__` in python",
    "body": "\n                \nI used super() as a part of the __setattr__ method to update a dictionary whenever an attribute value is set on an instance of a class; however, a warning reported as my class object has no such attribute '_attributes'. The code just like this:\nclass Vault:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self._treasure = \"gold\"\n        self._attributes = dict(self.__dict__)\n\n    def __setattr__(self, name, value):\n        if name != \"_attributes\" and name not in self._attributes:\n            print(\"attribute deleted!\")\n        self._attributes[name] = value\n        super().__setattr__(\"_attributes\", dict(self.__dict__))\n\n    @property\n    def treasure(self):\n        if self.__dict__ != self._attributes:\n            print(\"attribute deleted!\")\n        return self._treasure\n\nv = Vault()\nprint(v.treasure)\n\nMaybe there is an issue caused by the super()? I was new to use this method in Python and I was not sure, can someone help to explain it a bit?\nAnother problem occurred as I initally thought the problem was caused by the line self._attributes[name] = value inside the __setattr__ method since '_attributes' had not yet defined when the instance is created, so I fixed my code as below but it still not work. The warning reported a Recursion Error saying that the maximum recursion depth exceeded.\nclass Vault:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self._treasure = \"gold\"\n\n    def __setattr__(self, name, value):\n        if name != \"_attributes\" and name not in self.__dict__:\n            print(\"attribute deleted!\")\n        self.__dict__[name] = value\n        self._attributes = dict(self.__dict__)\n\n    @property\n    def treasure(self):\n        if self.__dict__ != self._attributes:\n            print(\"attribute deleted!\")\n        return self._treasure\n\nv = Vault()\nprint(v.treasure)\n\nIt will be super appreciated if someone may help me with this __setattr__ method and the bug fixing. This question is for my Python study and development, so it welcomes any answers and discussions.\nThe goal of this code is to create a class named 'Vault' containing an attribute named 'treasure' which returns 'gold' under normal circumstances, but a warning message such as 'attribute deleted' if it detects any of its attributes have been changed.\n    ",

My idea was to replace them with '<br>'.\nI have the following code:\ndef foo():\n        try:\n            somefunction(bar)\n        except Exception as e:\n            str_e = repr(e)\n            # replace the \"python\" linebreak with html line breaks\n            str_e_with_linebreaks = str_e.replace(\"\\\\r\", \"<br>\")\n            str_e_with_linebreaks = str_e_with_linebreaks.replace(\"\\\\n\", \"<br>\")\n            return str_e_with_linebreaks\n\n        return \"No errors were found in the provided data\"\n\n\n\nThe html that is returned to the user includes the \"<br>\" but doesn't have the desired linebreaks.\n\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n    <title>String Processor Result</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <h1>Result</h1>\n         <p>&lt;FormatViolationError - description=Payload for Action is syntactically incorrect or structure for Action, details={&#39;cause&#39;: &#34;Payload &#39;{&#39;status&#39;: &#39;Accept&#39;, &#39;Accept&#39; is not one of [&#39;Accepted&#39;, &#39;Failed&#39;]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Failed validating &#39;enum&#39; in schema[&#39;properties&#39;][&#39;status&#39;]:&lt;br&gt;    {&#39;additionalProperties&#39;: False,&lt;br&gt;     &#39;description&#39;: &#39;This indicates whether the charging station was able &#39;&lt;br&gt;                    &#39;to retrieve the OCSP certificate status.\\&lt;br&gt;\\&lt;br&gt;&#39;,&lt;br&gt;     &#39;enum&#39;: [&#39;Accepted&#39;, &#39;Failed&#39;],&lt;br&gt;     &#39;javaType&#39;: &#39;GetCertificateStatusEnum&#39;,&lt;br&gt;     &#39;type&#39;: &#39;string&#39;}&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On instance[&#39;status&#39;]:&lt;br&gt;    &#39;Accept&#39;&#34;, &#39;ocpp_message&#39;: &lt;CallResult - unique_id=8c5f1ba7-0167-4ef3-95cd-6efd88a6720f, action=GetCertificateStatus, payload={&#39;status&#39;: &#39;Accept&#39;}&gt;}&gt;</p>\n    <a href=\"/\">Back to input form</a>\n</body>\n</html>\n\n\nI am stuck. Most likely replacing the characters is not the way to go. How can I nicely format the error message and include it in an html?\nIn the actual app.py (flask web server). I include the returned error in the html with:\nresult = foo(data)\nreturn render_template('result.html', result=result)\n\n    ",

    "title": "How to handle Validations on Custom Control",
    "body": "\n                \nI recently wrote my first custom control, an autocomplete textbox. Its Controltemplate consists of something like this\n\n<Grid >\n  <Border/>\n  <TextBlock x:Name=\"Label\"/>\n  <TextBox x:Name=\"TextLabel\"/>\n</Grid>\n\n\nThe first Textblock is used as a Label, the second one shows the content. The TextLabel binds on an Object, let's call it Customer If the underlying search doesn't find a Customer object, I want to show the errortemplate. When defining the TextLabel like this\n\n<TextBox x:Name=\"PART_Editor\"\n    HorizontalAlignment=\"Stretch\"\n    VerticalAlignment=\"Center\"\n    Validation.ErrorTemplate=\"{DynamicResource ValidationErrorTemplate}\"\n    Style=\"{StaticResource TransparentTextBoxStyle}\"\n    Text=\"{Binding Path=Text, RelativeSource={RelativeSource Mode=TemplatedParent}, \n           Mode=TwoWay, ValidatesOnNotifyDataErrors=True, \n           NotifyOnValidationError=True, \n           ValidatesOnDataErrors=True, \n           UpdateSourceTrigger=PropertyChanged}\" >                                                                                \n</TextBox>\n\n\nthe Validation is made and the error template of the textbox is shown. Unfortunately the Red Border is only around the inner TextBox and not around the whole custom control which looks just not good. \n\nI was wondering how to achieve two things:\n\n\nHow can the ErrorTemplate of the CustomControl be triggered when one of the child-validations fail?\nDo I have to specify all these NotifyOnValidationerror properties or is it possible to catch all errors on entity level and show the same ErrorTemplate\n\n\nIf you need additional Information, please just ask\n    ",

XAML:\n\n<TextBox Text=\"{Binding TextBox1Message, Mode=TwoWay, UpdateSourceTrigger=PropertyChanged}\">\n    <TextBox.Style>\n        <Style TargetType=\"{x:Type TextBox}\">\n            <Style.Triggers>\n                <Trigger Property=\"Validation.HasError\" Value=\"true\">\n                    <Setter Property=\"ToolTip\" Value=\"{Binding RelativeSource={x:Static RelativeSource.Self}, Path=(Validation.Errors)[0].ErrorContent}\"/>\n                </Trigger>\n         </Style.Triggers>\n     </Style>\n   </TextBox.Style>\n</TextBox>\n\n\nThese WPF apps are also add-ins as defined by the MAF architecture (https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb384200(v=vs.110).aspx) and are consumed by a host application. Each add-in provides the host with a contentcontrol which the host displays in its main window. The WPF app continues to work as normal except it is being hosted by a window in another process.\n\nThe strange thing about this is that when the app is being hosted, the validation border does not display; however, the tool tip works as expected. \n\nWhy does the validation border not work as expected when the WPF app is running in a MAF environment?\n    ",

I have the following for my UserControl:\n<Style TargetType=\"local:LabelEdit\">\n    <Setter Property=\"Background\" Value=\"{StaticResource BackgroundBrush}\" />\n    <Setter Property=\"Foreground\" Value=\"{StaticResource ForegroundBrush}\" />\n    <Setter Property=\"BorderBrush\" Value=\"{StaticResource BorderBrush}\" />\n\n    <Setter Property=\"Validation.ErrorTemplate\">\n        <Setter.Value>\n            <ControlTemplate>\n                <StackPanel>\n                    <AdornedElementPlaceholder />\n                    <Image Source=\"/AJSoft.Controls;component/Resources/Icons/cross.ico\" />\n                </StackPanel>\n            </ControlTemplate>\n        </Setter.Value>\n    </Setter>\n\n    <Style.Triggers>\n        <Trigger Property=\"Validation.HasError\" Value=\"True\">\n            <Setter Property=\"Foreground\" Value=\"{StaticResource ErrorForegroundBrush}\" />\n            <Setter Property=\"Background\" Value=\"{StaticResource ErrorBackgroundBrush}\" />\n            <Setter Property=\"BorderBrush\" Value=\"{StaticResource ErrorBorderBrush}\" />\n        </Trigger>\n    </Style.Triggers>\n</Style>\n\nEverything works absolutely fine if I comment out the Setter for Validation.ErrorTemplate. If the ErrorTemplate is left intact, the cross shows (I haven't sorted out placement yet, but that can come later...), but the Textbox component of my UserControl does not show the caret or accept keyboard input. The rest of the controls in my Window work as expected.\nHere are some screenies where I've deliberately put in some erroneous text to show how it looks.\n\n\nThe same problem happens even if I change that huge image to be a textblock with a small red \"!\" - the image is just for effect for now.\nWhat am I doing that's causing the problem? I'm new to Validation in WPF...\nEDIT: The image shown (big red cross) is just one example of what I've done. Even if I use a small image shown alongside the UserControl, I still get the same effect.\n    ",

    "selected_answer": "\nIf you were to look at how error templates usually work, you'd see they apply to a single control.\nPart of the issue you have here is you've got a label and textbox in one parent user control.\nIf you then apply an error template at the usercontrol level, it's on everything in that. Label, textbox, everything in your usercontrol.\nThe next thing to consider is how your error template ends up visible on top of everything. This happens because your error template generates UI in the adorner layer. That's top of everything  ( in the window ).\nAdd these together and you got a big image on top of the content of your usercontrol.\nAt risk of over simplifying:\nYou put a top on your box and you can't now get at what's in that box.\nThere are several ways you could \"fix\" this but they all involve some design change or compromise.\nMaybe a big X on top of your input control isn't a good idea.\nYou could kind of make it work.\nYou could make your image IsHitTestVisible=\"False\".\nIt'll be visually in the way but you can then likely click on the textbox and type.\nJust maybe not see everything.\nProbably not ideal.\nYou could show your cross next to the textbox using a datatrigger rather than error template.\nAdd an image to your usercontrol so you have label, textbox, CrossImage.\nAdd a style to that with a setter makes it visible collapsed by default.\nUse a trigger in that style to show the CrossImage when the control has errors.\n <Style.Triggers>\n    <Trigger Property=\"Validation.HasError\" Value=\"true\">\n        <Setter ... />\n    </Trigger>\n </Style.Triggers>\n\nYou may well find it simplest to use the tag on the usercontrol and set that to visible/collapsed. Bind visibility of the image to that.\n    ",

    "title": "WPF - validation adorners do not position correctly when there multiple controls with validation errors",
    "body": "\n                \nI have a WPF application built with .NET Framework 4.8. I have a viewmodel that implements INotifyDataErrorInfo for validation. In my XAML I am using the default Validation.ErrorTemplate, but I have also tried using a custom template with the same results.\nIf I only have a few controls with validation errors, the default WPF validation adorners appear correctly. If have a lot of controls with validation errors the adorners do not always appear around the AdornedElement.\nHere is a sample application that demonstrates the issue:\nViewModel.cs\npublic  class ViewModel: INotifyPropertyChanged, INotifyDataErrorInfo\n{\n    private string _value;\n\n    public string Value\n    {\n        get { return _value; }\n        set\n        {\n            _value = value;\n            PropertyChanged?.Invoke(this, new PropertyChangedEventArgs(nameof(Value)));\n        }\n    }\n\n    public event PropertyChangedEventHandler PropertyChanged;\n\n    public IEnumerable GetErrors(string propertyName)\n    {\n        return new[]{\"Value cannot be null\"};\n    }\n\n    public bool HasErrors\n    {\n        get\n        {\n            return string.IsNullOrEmpty(_value);\n        }\n    }\n\n    public event EventHandler<DataErrorsChangedEventArgs> ErrorsChanged;\n    \n}\n\nMainWindow.xaml\n<\nWindow x:Class=\"ValidationErrorProblem.MainWindow\"\n        xmlns=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation\"\n        xmlns:x=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml\"\n        xmlns:d=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/expression/blend/2008\"\n        xmlns:mc=\"http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/markup-compatibility/2006\"\n        xmlns:local=\"clr-namespace:ValidationErrorProblem\"\n        mc:Ignorable=\"d\"\n        Title=\"MainWindow\" Height=\"800\" Width=\"400\">\n    <Grid>\n        <ScrollViewer HorizontalAlignment=\"Right\">\n            <ItemsControl x:Name=\"MyList\">\n                <ItemsControl.ItemTemplate>\n                    <DataTemplate DataType=\"{x:Type local:ViewModel}\">\n                        <TextBox Margin=\"5\" Text=\"{Binding Value}\" Width=\"100\"/>\n                    </DataTemplate>\n                </ItemsControl.ItemTemplate>\n            </ItemsControl>\n        </ScrollViewer>\n    </Grid>\n</Window>\n\nMainWindow.xaml.cs\npublic partial class MainWindow : Window\n{\n    public MainWindow()\n    {\n        InitializeComponent();\n\n        var items = new List<ViewModel>();\n        for (var i = 0; i < 200; i++) items.Add(new ViewModel());\n        MyList.ItemsSource = items;\n    }\n}\n\nHere is what it looks like when run the application and start scrolling:\n\nIf I resize the window after I scroll, it temporarily fixes the adorner placements.  But as soon as I scroll again, I get the same problem.\nI can fix this if I wrap the TextBox in its own AdornerDecorator. But my actual application contains multiple UserControls that each have hundreds of unique controls (TextBoxes, ComboBoxes, ToggleButtons, etc) that are not created from a template. I do not want to have to update my XAML to add more AdornerDecorators, especially not one for each control.\nThis seems like a bug in .Net Framework (4.8). Does anyone else have this problem, and have you found a simple fix?\n    ",

As others already mentioned in other related questions, TIMESTAMP values reference a specific point in time relative to January 1st, 1970 at UTC. DATETIME values on the contrary just store some date and time without a reference to any point in time. They are more like display values, a clock on the wall that shows you some value. A datetime of 2018-01-12 14:00:00 might be a different time in different timezones if you want to keep track of when something happened.\n\nTIMESTAMP on the other hand is always stored as UTC and when read or used in datetime function, automatically is converted back to the connection's or database default timezone. So when your connection is set to +02:00, the actual value that will be stored in the TIMESTAMP column, will be 2018-01-12 12:00:00 instead of 2018-01-12 14:00:00. When you then read the column with a +05:00 connection, you will see 2018-01-12 17:00:00. A DATETIME value would always stay at 2018-01-12 14:00:00 no matter what timezone is set for the database or connection.\n\nSo for tracking when something has happened or when something will/should happen, TIMESTAMP is the way to go. When you just want to store a fixed date time independent of the timezone, then use DATETIME (e.g. users shall receive an email at 2 in the morning, as 2 in the morning is the same for everyone).\n    ",

            "body": "\n\nAbout C1001, Microsoft Developer Network suggests that you remove some optimizations in your code: Fatal Error C1001. Once you've worked out which optimization is causing the issue, you can use a #pragma to disable that optimization in just that area:\n// Disable the optimization\n#pragma optimize( \"\", off )\n...\n// Re-enable any previous optimization\n#pragma optimize( \"\", on )\n\n\nAlso, a fix for this issue has been released by Microsoft. You could install the most recent release.\n\nconst and constexpr:\n\nconst declares an object as constant. This implies a guarantee that once initialized, the value of that object won't change, and the compiler can make use of this fact for optimizations. It also helps prevent the programmer from writing code that modifies objects that were not meant to be modified after initialization.\nconstexpr declares an object as fit for use in what the Standard calls constant expressions. But note that constexpr is not the only way to do this.\nWhen applied to functions the basic difference is this:\nconst can only be used for non-static member functions, not functions in general. It gives a guarantee that the member function does not modify any of the non-static data members.\nconstexpr can be used with both member and non-member functions, as well as constructors. It declares the function fit for use in constant expressions. The compiler will only accept it if the function meets certain criteria (7.1.5/3,4), most importantly:\nThe function body must be non-virtual and extremely simple: Apart from typedefs and static asserts, only a single return statement is allowed. In the case of a constructor, only an initialization list, typedefs, and static assert are allowed. (= default and = delete are allowed, too, though.)\nAs of C++14, the rules are more relaxed, what is allowed since then inside a constexpr function: asm declaration, a goto statement, a statement with a label other than case and default, try-block, the definition of a variable of non-literal type, definition of a variable of static or thread storage duration, the definition of a variable for which no initialization is performed.\nThe arguments and the return type must be literal types (i.e., generally speaking, very simple types, typically scalars or aggregates)\nWhen can I / should I use both, const and constexpr together?\nA. In object declarations. This is never necessary when both keywords refer to the same object to be declared. constexpr implies const.\nconstexpr const int N = 5;\nis the same as\n\nconstexpr int N = 5;\n\nHowever, note that there may be situations when the keywords each refer to different parts of the declaration:\nstatic constexpr int N = 3;\n\nint main()\n{\n  constexpr const int *NP = &N;\n}\n\nHere, NP is declared as an address constant-expression, i.e. a pointer that is itself a constant expression. (This is possible when the address is generated by applying the address operator to a static/global constant expression.) Here, both constexpr and const are required: constexpr always refers to the expression being declared (here NP), while const refers to int (it declares a pointer-to-const). Removing the const would render the expression illegal (because (a) a pointer to a non-const object cannot be a constant expression, and (b) &N is in-fact a pointer-to-constant).\nB. In member function declarations. In C++11, constexpr implies const, while in C++14 and C++17 that is not the case. A member function declared under C++11 as\nconstexpr void f();\nneeds to be declared as\n\nconstexpr void f() const;\n\nunder C++14 in order to still be usable as a const function.\nYou could refer to this link for more details.\n    ",

(https://godbolt.org/z/K6GnrYrj1 is ARM64 GCC trunk, with your command line args without the preprocessor stuff, which won't matter when compiling CPP output.)\nIf it still crashes with current GCC, then file a bug report on https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/, ideally with a MCVE of the part of the source that triggers the bug.  (Remove as many parts of the file as you can while preserving the crash behaviour.  e.g. take out tons of stuff, undo if that makes it compile.)\nIf it doesn't crash with newer GCC, it might already be a known bug, or got fixed by accident, or a different MPFR or other library version mattered.  In that case, maybe not worth reporting it upstream. Or if you do make sure to include the fact that the range of affected versions doesn't include GCC12 or current trunk.

    "title": "How to update timestamp column in MySQL with incorrect timestamp?",
    "body": "\n                \nI have a database (MySQL 8.0) with four timestamp columns, using the default timestamp settings, i.e. no fraction of seconds. I would like to start using fractions of a second, probably two decimals, so TIMESTAMP(2). The process that generates the data does not always provide a timestamp to column timestamp_column_3 (just renamed the columns as timestamp_column_1 to timestamp_column_4 here) and thus there are many '0000-00-00 00:00:00' in timestamp_column_3. When I tried converting the\ntimestamp_column_1 by running the following query:\nALTER TABLE table_name MODIFY COLUMN timestamp_column TIMESTAMP(2);\nI get the following response:\nError Code: 1292. Incorrect datetime value: '0000-00-00 00:00:00' for column 'timestamp_column_3' at row 74608.\nSo, two questions:\n\nWhy does timestamp_column_3 interfere with my altering of column timestamp_column_1?\nHow do I proceed to convert all four columns to datatype TIMESTAMP(2)?\n\nI looked around and found this answer to a similar question. But I'd rather not modify the mode of the database as I'm not very inexperienced and this is a production database. Is there a way to adjust the timestamps in the column to the minimum allowed (I assume this is 1970-01-01 00:00:00). I don't really care about the value. Also, I don't understand why the insertion process is allowed to insert these incorrect values as the mode is the following:\nSTRICT_TRANS_TABLES,\nNO_ZERO_IN_DATE,\nNO_ZERO_DATE,\nERROR_FOR_DIVISION_BY_ZERO,\nNO_ENGINE_SUBSTITUTION\n\nThe incorrect values doesn't really matter as we know they don't \"exist\" but of course it would be nice to have everything correct. What would then be the \"correct\" value instead of a ZERO_DATE?\n-- EDIT -- Add some information\nVersion: 8.0.18-google\nTable:\nCREATE TABLE `event` (\n  `c1` int(11) DEFAULT NULL,\n  `c2` varchar(32) NOT NULL,\n  `c3` varchar(32) NOT NULL,\n  `c4` varchar(64) NOT NULL,\n  `c5` varchar(64) NOT NULL,\n  `c6` varchar(64) NOT NULL,\n  `c7` varchar(64) NOT NULL,\n  `c8` varchar(64) NOT NULL,\n  `c9` varchar(128) DEFAULT NULL,\n  `timestamp_column_1` timestamp NOT NULL,\n  `timestamp_column_2` timestamp NOT NULL,\n  `timestamp_column_3` timestamp NULL DEFAULT NULL,\n  `timestamp_column_4` timestamp NOT NULL,\n  PRIMARY KEY (`c4`),\n  KEY `event-timestamp_column_1` (`timestamp_column_1`),\n  KEY `event-timestamp_column_3` (`timestamp_column_3`)\n) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci\n\n0, a, b, c, d, e, f, g, , 2021-02-19 07:45:30, 2021-02-19 07:45:29, 0000-00-00 00:00:00, 2021-06-03 20:11:45\n\nThe data is added through Google Storage CSV import function and timestamp_column_3 sometimes has no data in the CSV file, i.e. the column is just represented as ,, in the CSV.\n    ",

    "title": "\"1292 Incorrect datetime value\" when updating a different field",
    "body": "\n                \nThere are a lot of great Stackoverflow questions/answers with regard to this error. However, most (all) are focused on updating the problem field itself. For example, a common solution is to set sql_mode to NO_ENGINE_SUBSTITUTION (thus disabling strict mode) and then updating the field that currently has a 0000-00-00 value.\nHowever, my issue is slightly different. I have a table with multiple date columns (often for the same record) containing malformed data (0000-00-00). If I run a query to update one column, I get this error thrown for one of the other columns -- regardless of what sql_mode I set or whether I use UPDATE IGNORE. It's as if the sql_mode only applies to the column I'm updating, but errors are still thrown for the other columns.\nHere's a stripped down example:\nLet's say I have a table with three columns: id, created_date, modified date, and I have this row:\nid | created_date | modified date\n---------------------------------\n5  | 0000-00-00   | 0000-00-00\n\nThis query will error:\nUPDATE mytable SET created_date = NULL WHERE id = 5;\n\nand the error will be on the modified_date field.\nIf I update both fields, I get no error:\nUPDATE mytable SET created_date = NULL, modified_date = NULL WHERE id = 5;\n\nAgain -- I'm setting the sql_mode to ensure I'm not in strict mode or have either NO_ZERO_DATE or NO_ZERO_IN_DATE enabled. Also note that I am running MySQL 8.\nFor various reasons I can't easily run updates that affect both columns -- I need to do a single column at a time. But can't seem to get around this error.\n    ",

In at least the cases of malloc() and new, a failed allocation doesn't do anything other than report failure (it doesn't corrupt any internal data structures, for example).\nWhether it makes sense to try to recover depends on the application. If the application just can't succeed after an allocation failure, then it should do whatever cleanup it can and terminate.

The standard way to do this seems to be to implement a parse_constant method and then pass this method to json.loads.\nExample:\ndef parse_constant(c: str) -> float:\n    if c == \"NaN\":\n        raise ValueError(\"NaN is not valid JSON\")\n    return float(c)\n\njson_content = json.loads(some_json_string, parse_constant=parse_constant)\n\nApparently, the decode implementation does not catch the ValueError and transform it into a JSONDecodeError, which forces me to check for both exception types. I miss the context (line number, JSON document) to build the decode error myself. I know I could just catch ValueError, but is there a way to configure the json module to raise what I would expect to be the logical exception type?\n    ",

            "body": "\nTL;DR: better_errors is better.\n\nI disagree with the accepted answer here. Mainly because the difference suggested aren't real. \n\nIt's always been trivial to trigger a better_errors console anywhere you wanted, as easy as raise 'bang'. You throw an exception at the point you want and a console gets started in that context. You can raise an exception in any of your files or views and get a console in that context. \n\nI'm not sure if the accepted answer was implying that web_console wouldn't get triggered on an exception and that's why he suggested using both gems, but in any case it's now true that web_console does trigger on exceptions too.\n\nSo given there's no functional difference, well, firstly, there's no point running both gems. In fact I'd expect conflicts, though maybe it just comes down to which one catches the exception first.\n\nSecondly, the real difference is that better_errors is just better. Look at screenshots of the two. web_console is just the standard rails exception page with a bare black terminal under it. If you want to know local or instance variables you have to inspect them with the console. better_errors has (to my taste at least) a much prettier styled page, but more importantly it shows the call stack (with compact or full listings), it gives you the code listing where it was triggered just above the console and then below the console it lists request/local/instance variables, which will often explain what the problem is without having to do anything in the console itself. That's a bunch of extra, useful features and nothing missing that web_console has (unless minimalism is your bag).\n\nI don't know why 37Signals/Basecamp or the Rails team decided to incorporate web_console rather than better_errors. Maybe there are design-philosophy/architectural reasons they want to keep it at arms length, maybe they think it's too full featured to be automatically included. Some people seem to think 37Signals strongly prefers stuff built in-house or that can be taken in-house, and maybe that's the only reason why.\n\nOther things that have changed since Thiago posted are that, as marklar says, you now start web_console with console not debug and that web_console no longer suggests better_errors as an alternative in its GH README.\n    ",

When I try to use this in the SQL tab of one of my tables in phpMyAdmin, it gives me an error: \n\n#1066 - Not unique table/alias: 'm'\n\n\nThe exact query I'm trying to use is:\n\nselect r.*,m.SkuAbbr, v.VoucherNbr from arrc_RedeemActivity r, arrc_Merchant m, arrc_Voucher v\nLEFT OUTER JOIN arrc_Merchant m ON (r.MerchantID = m.MerchantID)\nLEFT OUTER JOIN arrc_Voucher v ON (r.VoucherID = v.VoucherID)\n\n\nI'm not entirely certain it will do what I need it to do or that I'm using the right kind of join (my grasp of SQL is pretty limited at this point), but I was hoping to at least see what it produced. \n\n(What I'm trying to do, if anyone cares to assist, is get all columns from arrc_RedeemActivity, plus SkuAbbr from arrc_Merchant where the merchant IDs match in those two tables, plus VoucherNbr from arrc_Voucher where VoucherIDs match in those two tables.)\n\nEdited to add table samples\n\nTable arrc_RedeemActivity\nRedeemID | VoucherID | MerchantID | RedeemAmt\n----------------------------------------------\n1        | 2         |  3         | 25\n2        | 6         |  5         | 50\n\nTable arrc_Merchant\nMerchantID | SkuAbbr\n---------------------\n3         | abc         \n5         | def         \n\nTable arrc_Voucher\nVoucherID | VoucherNbr\n-----------------------\n2         | 12345       \n6         | 23456\n\n\nSo ideally, what I'd like to get back would be:\n\nRedeemID | VoucherID | MerchantID | RedeemAmt | SkuAbbr | VoucherNbr\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n1        | 2         | 3          | 25        | abc     | 12345\n2        | 2         | 5          | 50        | def     | 23456\n\n    ",

    "body": "\n                \nI hate to admit it by my knowledge of MySQL is lacking when it comes to the more complex queries. Essentially I have four tables  two of them contain the data I want to return, and two are relational tables linking the data. Table A is present just to provide filler for Table D.aID.\n\n+--------+ +--------+ +--------+ +-----------+ +-----------+\n|Table A | |Table B | |Table C | |  Table D  | |  Table E  |\n+---+----+ +---+----+ +---+----+ +---+---+---+ +---+---+---+\n|aID|name| |bID|name| |cID|name| |dID|aID|bID| |eID|dID|cID|\n+---+----+ +---+----+ +---+----+ +---+---+---+ +---+---+---+\n| 1 | a_1| | 1 | b_1| | 1 | c_1| | 1 | 1 | 1 | | 1 | 1 | 1 |\n+---+----+ | 2 | b_2| | 2 | c_2| | 2 | 1 | 2 | | 1 | 1 | 2 |\n           +---+----+ | 3 | c_3| +---+---+---+ +---+---+---+\n                      +---+----+\n\n\nThe relationship created with these tables is: Table A > Table B > Table C. The data I am wanting belongs to the Table B > Table C relationship.\n\n+--------+---------+--------+---------+\n|tblB.bID|tblB.name|tblC.cID|tblC.name|\n+--------+---------+--------+---------+\n|    1   |    a_1  |    1   |   c_1   |\n|    1   |    a_1  |    2   |   c_2   |\n|    2   |    a_2  |  NULL  |   NULL  |\n+--------+---------+--------+---------+\n\n\nHowever to ensure I am following the correct path I need to grab the Table B of the Table A > Table B relationship Table C belongs to. I realize that I am making things much more difficult for myself by allowing for duplicate name values, but I would rather have small tables and more complex queries than bloated tables and simpler queries. The query I am using is\n\nSELECT * FROM `Table E`\nLEFT JOIN `Table D` ON (`Table B`.bID = `Table D`.bID)\nRIGHT JOIN `Table E` ON (`Table D`.dID = `Table E`.dID))\nRIGHT JOIN `Table C` ON (`Table E.cID = `Table C`.cID);\n\n\nHowever so far it has not worked. When the query is submitted this error is returned:\n\nERROR 1066 (42000): Not unique table/alias: 'Table D'\n\n\nAny ideas on how I can get this to work? Is this even possible?\n    ",

        "Django needs a primary key on the table, are there any specific reasons you absolutely can't have one? How is the primary key adversely affecting you? Yes, MySQL is just letting you know that the column is indexed and it's not unique (UNI) or primary (PRI).  From the MySQL docs: \"If Key is MUL, multiple occurrences of a given value are permitted within the column. The column is the first column of a nonunique index or a unique-valued index that can contain NULL values.\"",
        "Well, the primary key is supposed to be the composite of the identifier and timestamp rather than an auto id for this table. With django setting it's own primary key, I wasn't able to see how the unique_together was able to preserve the two column primary key behavior. If a MUL key is able to be nonunique or unique with null values, how can it function as a primary key?",
        "The MUL concerns itself only with the column, not the combination of the two columns. Have you tested trying to insert duplicate values for the two columns?",

            "body": "\nI have run into this issue multiple times, and modonoghue has one valid way of handling it by dropping your tables and completely recreating them. \n\nProblem & a General Solution\n\nBasically what is happening is that you are trying to run INSERT statements that are inserting values into primary keys that already exist - thereby giving you an error of duplicate keys. The database has no clue how to handle having multiple entries with the same key, as SQL logic is based around every 'row' having a primary key that is completely unique.\n\nWhat you want to do is to save all the values to your exported sql file, in a query that, when you import the file again, deletes all the existing values (assuming you want to restore it to a certain point and aren't worrying about data saved between your export date and your import date!) and inserts all the exported values ... or somehow else avoids trying to add a new entry with an existing key (see following).\n\nOne method to export a specific database (TRUNCATE):\n\n\nIn other words, when you are using PHPMYADMIN to export your sql file, click \"Custom - display all possible options\".\nUnder \"Format-Specific Options\" make sure \"structure and data\" is selected (otherwise you may end up dropping your tables and not having the data to restore them with!!!)\nUnder \"Data Creation Options\" select \"Truncate table before insert\" -- this will delete all the existing data in the tables.\n\n\nWhen you import, all the existing data will be deleted from each table (TRUNCATE) and all the exported data will be written back to the tables (INSERT) but the tables themselves won't be deleted (DROP).\n\nIGNORE vs TRUNCATE (Alternative Route)\n\nYou should be able to skip Step 3 above (TRUNCATE) and instead select the checkbox \"Instead of INSERT Statements Use ...\" \"INSERT IGNORE statements\"\n\nBasically, \"IGNORE\" will just skip over duplicates in your exported data, and prevents you from having to delete your existing data. This is good if you want to just add back lost data, without deleting data that's been changed / added since the last export.\n\nSuperuser (ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE)\n\nThere is also an INSERT INTO ... ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE ... that allows you to tell the query exactly what to do if there is a duplicate key. This prevents you from just ignoring two entries with identical keys that may not be identical entries. It is more complicated to setup properly, however.\n    ",

If I export each table individually and import it into the new database everything works properly. But if I export the entire database I receive\n\nerror 1068 multiple primary key defined.\n\nAfter examining the dump it would appear that after the data is imported there is a section at the end of the dump which is called \"Indexes for dumped tables\". This index tries to recreate the already imported primary key which in turn causes the error.\nI have researched for hours on error 1068 but nothing seems to address my situation. To me it would seem easiest to simply create the dump wiyhout the index tables at the end. But unfortunately I am unabe to workout the option to do this.\nSo my question is it possible to make phpmyadmin create a dump without these indexes? And if so how?\n    ",

    "title": "How to stop ANTLR from suppressing syntax errors?",
    "body": "\n                \nSo I'm writing a compiler in Java using ANTLR, and I'm a little puzzled by how it deals with errors.\n\nThe default behavior seems to be to print an error message and then attempt, by means of token insertion and such, to recover from the error and continue parsing. I like this in principle; it means that (in the best case) if the user has committed more than one syntax error, they'll get one message per error, but it'll mention all the errors instead of forcing them to recompile to discover the next one. The default error message is fine for my purposes. The trouble comes when it's done reading all the tokens.\n\nI am, of course, using ANTLR's tree constructors to build abstract syntax trees. While it's nice for the parse to continue through syntax errors so the user can see all the errors, once it's done parsing I want to get an exception or some kind of indication that the input wasn't syntactically valid; that way I can stop the compilation and tell the user \"sorry, fix your syntax errors and then try again\". What I don't want is for it to spit out an incomplete AST based on what it thinks the user was trying to say, and continue to the next phase of compilation with no indication that anything went wrong (other than the error messages which went to the console and I can't see). Yet by default, it does exactly that.\n\nThe Definitive ANTLR Reference offers a technique to stop parsing as soon as a syntax error is detected: override the mismatch and recoverFromMismatchedSet methods to throw RecognitionExceptions, and add a @rulecatch action to do the same. This would seem to lose the benefit of recovering from parse errors, but more importantly, it only partially works. If a necessary token is missing (for instance, if a binary operator only has an expression on one side of it), it throws an exception just as expected, but if an extraneous token is added, ANTLR inserts the token that it thinks belongs there and continues on its merry way, producing an AST with no indication of a syntax error except a console message. (To make matters worse, the token it inserted was EOF, so the rest of the file didn't even get parsed.)\n\nI'm sure I could fix this by, say, adding something like an isValid field to the parser and overriding methods and adding actions so that, at the end of the parse, it throws an exception if there were any errors. But is there a better way? I can't imagine that what I'm trying to do is unusual among ANTLR users.\n    ",

When you have an input sequence like\n\npackage x import\n\n\ndo you want it to assume there should have been a semicolon there, or do you want it to assume something else got stuck in before the semicolon and it should throw stuff away until it gets to a semicolon?\n\nThe latter is what you have -- the rule package: PACKAGE error ';' does precisely that -- whenever it sees the keyword PACKAGE but what come after it does not match the rest of the package rule, it should throw away input until it sees a ';' and try to continue from there.\n\nIf you want the former, you would use a rule like package: PACKAGE name error -- if it sees PACKAGE with something that looks like a valid package name but no semicolon, treat it as if there was a semicolon there and try to continue.\n\nMaking it be able to do BOTH of the above things is extremely difficult.  The closest would be having the grammar look something like:\n\npackage: PACKAGE name ';'  /* normal package decl */\n       | PACKAGE name      /* missing semicolon -- treat this as a semantic error */\n       | PACKAGE error ';' /* no name -- skip up to the next semicolon to recover */\n\n\nHowever, this sort of thing will probably give you grammar conflicts that are hard to resolve.          \n    ",

    "body": "\n                \nGiven an Android intent service whose job is do background network communication (e.g. make a REST call to synchronize data), when the intent service catches an IOException, what is a good practice for recovering from the error?\n\nLet's assume the amount of data transferred is small enough that we're content retry the network operation from scratch. If the device lost network connection, we want to be notified when connectivity is restored and try again. If we didn't lose connection, we assume the server or its network link is down, and want to try again after a delay.\n\nIt is not critical to complete the communication operation as soon as possible, but quicker does mean a better user experience, although it must be traded off against bandwidth usage and battery life.\n\nHopefully, this is a common requirement and the functionality is baked into Android. If so, where is it, or if not, what would the code to intelligently restart the intent service look like?\n    ",

        "@sandrstar: I'm trying to be friendly to the user's battery. If there is no network connection, there is no point in burning CPU to retry. In the case of server down, would you really want a simple counter? For example, if you tried at 1-minute intervals and had a counter that gave up after 10 tries, then what? You probably don't really want to give up, but rather slow down you retry rate, since it's just a longer transient problem.",

However, for some sports apps (e.g. display scores for some championship) I've used just three attempts (in case if I get IOException - then do no repeat calls, do it only in case of ClientProtocolException or some strange status/data from the server).",

    "body": "\n                \nI have a LAMP website (PHP/MySQL), and I rely heavily on my MySQL database.\n\nRecently, the following error started occurring intermittently:\n\n[30-Oct-2011 16:11:49] PHP Warning:  mysqli_connect() [<a href='function.mysqli-connect'>function.mysqli-connect</a>]: (HY000/2013): Lost connection to MySQL server at 'sending authentication information', system error: 32 in /home/path/to/my/code.php on line 1029\n\n\nThis is line 1029, the specific line that occasionally gives the above error:\n\n$db = mysqli_connect($cfg['db_location'], $cfg['db_reader_username'], $cfg['db_reader_password']);\n\n\nwhere $cfg['db_location'] is \"localhost\", and the username and password are correct.\n\nIt appears as though something is causing my PHP script to intermittently lose connection to the MySQL server, which is puzzling to me because all of my MySQL connections are made to localhost. That is, the PHP script and the MySQL server are both running on the same box, and I connect to MySQL via localhost.\n\nAdditionally, this is puzzling because my PHP script is able to successfully connect to the MySQL server for perhaps 90% of pages.\n\nAs best I can tell, my server has plenty of available RAM and CPU:\n\ntop - 16:38:23 up 173 days, 19:19,  2 users,  load average: 0.57, 0.78, 0.84\nTasks: 142 total,   4 running, 137 sleeping,   0 stopped,   1 zombie\nCpu(s): 18.7%us, 27.5%sy,  0.7%ni, 52.6%id,  0.2%wa,  0.1%hi,  0.2%si,  0.0%st\nMem:   2976260k total,  1861368k used,  1114892k free,   532628k buffers\nSwap:  2048248k total,      116k used,  2048132k free,  1035804k cached\n\n\nAnd plenty of available disk space. When I run df -h, all of my filesystems are at most 25% in use.\n\nSo I don't know what would be causing the sporadic errors that I'm seeing in my PHP error logs.\n\nAny ideas what might be causing my PHP script to intermittently lose connection to my MySQL server on localhost?\n\nI upgraded to MySQL 5.1, and this is now what get when I run mysql -V:\n\nmysql  Ver 14.14 Distrib 5.1.56, for pc-linux-gnu (i686) using readline 5.1\n\n\nThe same errors are still happening, though:\n\n[30-Oct-2011 20:26:18] PHP Warning:  mysqli_connect() [<a href='function.mysqli-connect'>function.mysqli-connect</a>]: (HY000/2013): Lost connection to MySQL server at 'sending authentication information', system error: 32 in /home/path/to/my/code.php on line 1029\n\n\nAs before, the errors continue to be intermittent.\n\nAfter I upgraded to MySQL 5.1, I've been looking carefully at my PHP errors logs. I've noticed a few other errors similar to the first one. For example, here's one such error:\n\n[30-Oct-2011 22:42:29] PHP Warning:  mysqli_connect() [<a href='function.mysqli-connect'>function.mysqli-connect</a>]: (HY000/2013): Lost connection to MySQL server at 'reading authorization packet', system error: 104 in /home/path/to/my/code.php on line 1029\n\n\nAnd here's another error I've seen in my logs:\n\nPHP Warning:  mysqli::mysqli() [<a href='mysqli.mysqli'>mysqli.mysqli</a>]: (HY000/2002): Can't connect to local MySQL server through socket '/var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock' (2) in /home/path/to/different/code.php on line 7\n\n\nIn all cases, the problem fundamentally seems to be a failure to connect to MySQL. Any ideas what might be causing this or how I could debug it?\n    ",

I dont see any options on their website to set any configuration for the server. \n\nPlease help me. Thanks.\n    ",

        {
            "body": "\nIf you need the count before the joins occur then you have to generate the count before you join.\n\nThis is one method to accomplish that:\n\nSELECT A.Port_ID, A.refoct2015, B.refSept2015 , C.RefOct2014 \nFROM (SELECT Port_ID, Booking_Date, count(Ref) as refoct2015 \n      FROM report\n      GROUP BY Port_Id, Booking_Date) A\nINNER JOIN \n     (SELECT Port_ID, Booking_Date, count(Ref) as refSept2015 \n      FROM Report_sept2015\n      GROUP BY Port_Id, Booking_Date) B \n  ON A.Port_ID = B.Port_ID\nINNER JOIN \n     (SELECT Port_ID, Booking_Date, count(Ref) as RefOct2014 \n      FROM report_oct2014\n      GROUP BY Port_Id, Booking_Date) C \n  ON B.Port_ID = C.Port_ID\n\n\nThough it seems odd to include booking_date and not join on it...\n\nIf I have in table A 100 distinct dates and in table B 100 distinct dates, and in table c 100 distinct dates, then your result set would be 100*100*100 assuming each share the same port_Id... probably why its taking 15 minutes...  Sure you're not missing a join?\n\nThis seems to make more sense to me...\n\nSELECT A.Port_ID, A.refoct2015, B.refSept2015 , C.RefOct2014 \nFROM (SELECT Port_ID, Booking_Date, count(Ref) as refoct2015 \n      FROM report\n      GROUP BY Port_Id, Booking_Date) A\nINNER JOIN \n     (SELECT Port_ID, Booking_Date, count(Ref) as refSept2015 \n      FROM Report_sept2015\n      GROUP BY Port_Id, Booking_Date) B \n  ON A.Port_ID = B.Port_ID\n and A.Booking_date= B.Booking_date\nINNER JOIN \n     (SELECT Port_ID, Booking_Date, count(Ref) as RefOct2014 \n      FROM report_oct2014\n      GROUP BY Port_Id, Booking_Date) C \n  ON B.Port_ID = C.Port_ID\n and A.Booking_date= B.Booking_date\n\n\nHowever this implies that if dates and port IDs are not in all tables then you'd have a problem. with data elimination due to the inner join.  Normally I'd use a Full outer join to resolve this but mySQL doesn't support it.  You'd have to use Outer joins and unions to simulate the behavior.\n\nSo rather than continue to guess at what you're after.  Explain what those tables are for and what you're trying to do accomplish in plain English; in your original question by editing it.  \n\nI'm afraid we're falling into the XY problem here\n\nWhy is booking_date relevant if it's not in the select?  \n\nIt really seems like you're trying to pivot the data from these three tables by date...but then not showing date....\n\nAre you after something like\n\nPort_Id   Date    Oct2015  Sept2015  Oct2014\n1        1/1/2015     500       250        0\n1        1/2/2015     100        60        0\n2        1/1/2015     100       540       60\n\n\n?\n    ",

Even if I uncheck \"Reopen windows when logging back in\" before shutdown or restart. Chrome and textmate do not appear on loggin items on Users & Groups from System Preferences so I can't uncheck them. Is very weird and I don't really know what to do. Some good ideas? Thanks!\n\nI also delete textmate and chrome files from ~/Library/Saved Application State. But it didn't work. Thanks!\n    ",

So to overcome I replace these first, before encoding by str_replace.\nI cannot get this to work when I read from the url, the $arrayElements is NULL.\nHowever, if I access the url in a webbrowser and copy the url content to a string variable everything works just fine.\nThe code is like this.\n    // URL of the JSON API\n    $url = 'https://www.tilastopaja.com/json/swe/sweAPI.php?type=clubs';\n\n    // Fetch the content from the URL\n    $jsonData = file_get_contents($url);\n\n    //Handle '-exceptions\n    $jsonData = str_replace(\"I'm a runner IF\", \"Im a runner IF\", $jsonData);\n    $jsonData = str_replace(\"Renners Runner's IF\", \"Renners Runners IF\", $jsonData);\n    $jsonData = str_replace(\"Runners' Store IK\", \"Runners Store IK\", $jsonData);\n\n    // Decode the JSON data into a PHP array\n    $arrayElements = json_decode($jsonData, true);\n\n    // Check if decoding was successful\n    if ($arrayElements === null) {\n        die('Error decoding JSON data');\n    }\n\n    // Check content of array\n    var_dump($arrayElements);\n\nI have checked that the $jsonData = file_get_contents($url); reads the data and that content is put into $jsonData\nAdditionally I also removed the CR/LF by introducing the below, prior to json_decode\n    //Handle CR/LF?\n    $jsonData = str_replace(\"\\n\\r\", \"\", $jsonData);\n    $jsonData = str_replace(\"\\n\", \"\", $jsonData);\n    $jsonData = str_replace(\"\\r\", \"\", $jsonData);\n\nBut - I am still not able to do the json_decode of the url content.\nAny ideas on how I can overcome this and read out the data provided by the url?\nAs I mentioned, the url is publicly exposed and not possible for me to change.\nPlease disregard the non-optimal coding style, this is just for clarity.\nBest regards,\n/Niklas\n    ",

Thanks in advance!\nExpecting the media file to be successfully uploaded. Tried different media files, checked if the file is present and opens properly before the function call. The file opens and prints the file size ( around 1-2 MBs ) before the media_upload / simple_upload function calls, but fails when the API makes the media upload call.

The second time you run it, you get that url I'm guessing from somewhere in your code where it was trying to save some info (as JSON) from the first run but failed and ended up saving a bad JSON file.  So when reading it on the second run, it fails.  That's the best I can come up with.",

Checked my app configurations on my Twitter dev account ( attached as images on my post above ), and everything seems to be okay. Do you have the same app access configurations?",
        "Well, Forbidden means most likely that the URL you're using is wrong.  If it's a credentials issue, \"normally\", it'd be \"Not authorized\", but I'm just guessing here.  Check if your URL is correct."

In initializers/backtrace_cleaner.rb:\n\nRails.backtrace_cleaner.remove_silencers!\n\nif ENV['ENGINES_HOME']\n  Rails.backtrace_cleaner.add_filter { |line| line.sub(ENV['ENGINES_HOME'], \"engines\") } \nend\n\nRails.backtrace_cleaner.add_silencer { |line| line !~ /^\\/?(app|config|lib|spec|engines)/}\n\n    ",

This is because the combination of filters and silencers in Rails::BacktraceCleaner end up removing lines from the engine, in which the errors occurs, because it is outside the Rails root.\n\nUsually, as in this case, when all lines have been filtered out by the backtrace cleaner ActionDispatch::DebugExceptions#log_error will display the full backtrace as fallback to displaying nothing.\n\nHowever when using better_errors the usual Rails code, in #log_error, does not appear it be called. I speculate that better_errors monkey patches Rails. Either way better_errors uses Rails.backtrace_cleaner filtering out all lines without a fallback for the case when all lines have been filtered out.\n    ",

    "body": "\n                \nHi I have a question concerning error-messages. \n\nI have a window with several buttons including a OK and Cancel-button. My OK-button executes a program that moves some chart series and for doing so it needs to read in lots of data from a file and shift these values. The Cancel button cancels this operation. The calculations cannot be separated into smaller portions of code. \n\nThis works well for smaller amount of data but when I use it with large sets of data the program acts as if it crashed. Nevertheless, after some time everything is back to normal, the calculation is done. \n\nThere are 2 things I don`t like: \n\n\n1) When I leave the program alone the program changes the headerline of my window to ....(keine Rückmeldung) which means no response. \n\n\n\nAfter the end of the calculation  the text  ...(keine Rückmeldung) disappears in the header and everything is back to normal. \n2) When I try to press the \"cancel\" button in my window while running the calculation, an additional window appears:\n\n\n\nThere again, when I leave the program alone and the calculation is finished this window disappears ( as well as the (keine Rückmeldung)  in the header of my window) and and everything is back to normal.\n\n\nTo solve problem 2 I tried to disable my \"Cancel\" button but this does not help. The slot which is behnid the cancel-button gets executed anyway. \n\nMy question now is: Since I don´t want the user to see these error-messages, is there a way to prevent the program of showing them?\n\nThank you\n    ",

    "body": "\n                \nThere is a comprehensive article about searching and sorting by related model in CGridView here: http://www.yiiframework.com/wiki/281/searching-and-sorting-by-related-model-in-cgridview/  I've successfully implemented this recipe a number of times.\n\nHowever, now I am trying to search and sort by a relation that is in the same table (it defines the parent_id). See 'parent' relation below:\n\npublic function relations()\n{\n    return array(\n        'parent' => array(self::BELONGS_TO, 'Category', 'parent_id'),\n        'children' => array(self::HAS_MANY, 'Category', 'parent_id'),\n        'childCount' => array(self::STAT, 'Category', 'parent_id'),\n        'author0' => array(self::BELONGS_TO, 'User', 'author'),\n        'contents' => array(self::MANY_MANY, 'Content', 'content_category(content_id, category_id)'),\n        'crsContents' => array(self::MANY_MANY, 'ContentCrs', 'content_category(content_id, category_id)'),\n    );\n}\n\npublic function defaultScope()\n{\n    return array(\n        'alias'=>'cat',\n        'order'=>\"cat.name ASC\",\n    );\n}\n\n\nWhen I implement the method as specified by the wiki, I get the following error:\n\nCDbCommand failed to execute the SQL statement: SQLSTATE[42000]: Syntax error or access violation: 1066 Not unique table/alias: 'cat'. The SQL statement executed was: SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT `cat`.`id`) FROM `category` `cat` LEFT OUTER JOIN `category` `cat` ON (`cat`.`parent_id`=`cat`.`id`) WHERE (cat.parent_id <> 257)\n\n\nHow can I ensure that the LEFT OUTER JOIN uses a unique table alias such as parent for the relation so that I can properly define my CDbCriteria in search()\n\nEDIT:\n\nAs requested by @tereško, here is my search() function.  I know it is flawed due to the table alias parent specified when I have not defined it... I just don't know how!\n\npublic function search()\n{\n    $criteria=new CDbCriteria;\n    $criteria->with = array('parent');\n\n    $criteria->compare('id',$this->id,true);\n    $criteria->compare('author',$this->author,true);\n    $criteria->compare('name',$this->name,true);\n    $criteria->compare('description',$this->description,true);\n    $criteria->compare('parent_id',$this->parent_id,true);\n    $criteria->compare('parent.name', $this->parent_search, true );\n    $criteria->compare('type',$this->type,true);\n    $criteria->compare('slug',$this->slug,true);\n    $criteria->compare('created',$this->created,true);\n    $criteria->compare('updated',$this->updated,true);\n\n    return new CActiveDataProvider($this, array(\n        'criteria'=>$criteria,\n            'sort'=>array(\n                'attributes'=>array(\n                    'parent_search'=>array(\n                        'asc'=>'parent.name',\n                        'desc'=>'parent.name DESC',\n                    ),\n                    '*',\n                ),\n            ),\n        )\n    );\n}\n\n    ",

I had a composite primary key on two columns which caused problems when I started to queue jobs because the framework serialized only the $primaryKey of the model (you can't define two columns as $primaryKey in models. So I added an auto increment primary column to the migration:\n\n$this->bigIncrements('id')->primary();\n\n\nThis caused the error message which you are getting. After removing the primary() call it worked and I noticed that the primary key got automatically set.\nInstead I am now using a composite unique key:\n\n$table->unique(['column_a', 'column_b']);\n\n\nI hope this helps in your case.\n    ",

So your subsequent primary key declaration attempts to create another primary key, which is not allowed.\nAn autoincrementing id column does not have to be the primary key, but it must be an index.\nTry this:\n    function (Blueprint $table) { \n      $table->increments('media_id');\n      $table->string('mediable_type');\n      $table->integer('mediable_id')->unsigned();\n      $table->string('tag');\n      $table->integer('order')->unsigned();\n\n      /* create an index for the autoincrement column */\n      $table->unique('media_id');  \n      /* drop the primary key */\n      $table->dropPrimary(); \n      /* add your new primary key */\n      $table->primary(['media_id', 'mediable_type', 'mediable_id', 'tag']);\n\n      $table->index(['mediable_id', 'mediable_type']);\n      $table->index('tag');\n      $table->index('order');\n      $table->foreign('media_id')\n                  ->references('id')->on('media')\n                  ->cascadeOnDelete();\n  }\n\nI haven't tested this however.\nIf you can't get Laravel to cooperate with using a different PK than the autoincrement column, you may have to use an ordinary index. You can alter the indexes later with SQL statements if you really need your compound primary key.  Something like this should work.\nALTER TABLE mediables \n     ADD UNIQUE INDEX media_id (media_id),\n     DROP PRIMARY KEY,\n     ADD PRIMARY KEY (media_id, mediable_type, mediable_id, tag);\n\nDo this all in one statement.\nBecause your new primary key starts with the autoincrementing column, you actually can omit the UNIQUE index, giving\nALTER TABLE mediables \n     DROP PRIMARY KEY,\n     ADD PRIMARY KEY (media_id, mediable_type, mediable_id, tag);\n\n    ",

            "body": "\nThere are two possibilities for handling mistakes in Marpa.\n\n“Ruby Slippers” Parsing\n\nMarpa maintains a lot of context during scanning. We can use this context so that the parser can require some token, and we can decide whether we want to offer it to Marpa even if it isn't in the input. Consider for example a programming language that requires any statement to be terminated by a semicolon. We can then use Ruby Slippers techniques to insert semicolons at specific locations, such as at the end of a line, or before a closing brace:\n\nuse strict;\nuse warnings;\nuse Marpa::R2;\nuse Data::Dump 'dd';\n\nmy $grammar = Marpa::R2::Scanless::G->new({\n    source => \\q{\n        :discard ~ ws\n        Block         ::= Statement+ action => ::array\n        Statement     ::= StatementBody (STATEMENT_TERMINATOR) action => ::first\n        StatementBody ::= 'statement'       action => ::first\n                      |   ('{') Block ('}') action => ::first\n        STATEMENT_TERMINATOR ~ ';'\n        event ruby_slippers = predicted STATEMENT_TERMINATOR\n        ws ~ [\\s]+\n    },\n});\nmy $recce = Marpa::R2::Scanless::R->new({ grammar => $grammar });\n\nmy $input = q(\n    statement;\n    { statement }\n    statement\n    statement\n);\n\nfor (\n  $recce->read(\\$input);\n  $recce->pos < length $input;\n  $recce->resume\n) {\n    ruby_slippers($recce, \\$input);\n}\nruby_slippers($recce, \\$input);\ndd $recce->value;\n\nsub ruby_slippers {\n    my ($recce, $input) = @_;\n    my %possible_tokens_by_length;\n\n    my @expected = @{ $recce->terminals_expected };\n    for my $token (@expected) {\n        pos($$input) = $recce->pos;\n\n        if ($token eq 'STATEMENT_TERMINATOR') {\n            # fudge a terminator at the end of a line, or before a closing brace\n            if ($$input =~ /\\G \\s*? (?: $ | [}] )/smxgc) {\n                push @{ $possible_tokens_by_length{0} }, [STATEMENT_TERMINATOR => ';'];\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    my $max_length = 0;\n    for (keys %possible_tokens_by_length) {\n        $max_length = $_ if $_ > $max_length;\n    }\n    if (my $longest_tokens = $possible_tokens_by_length{$max_length}) {\n        for my $lexeme (@$longest_tokens) {\n            $recce->lexeme_alternative(@$lexeme);\n        }\n        $recce->lexeme_complete($recce->pos, $max_length);\n\n        return ruby_slippers($recce, $input);\n    }\n}\n\n\nIn the ruby_slippers function, you could also count how often you needed to fudge a token. If that count exceeds some value, you could abandon the parse by throwing an error.\n\nSkipping input\n\nIf your input may contain unparseable junk, you can try skipping that if no lexeme would otherwise be found. For this, the $recce->resume method takes an optional position argument, where the normal parsing will resume.\n\nuse strict;\nuse warnings;\nuse Marpa::R2;\nuse Data::Dump 'dd';\nuse Try::Tiny;\n\nmy $grammar = Marpa::R2::Scanless::G->new({\n    source => \\q{\n        :discard ~ ws\n        Sentence ::= WORD+ action => ::array\n        WORD ~ 'foo':i | 'bar':i | 'baz':i | 'qux':i\n        ws ~ [\\s]+\n    },\n});\nmy $recce = Marpa::R2::Scanless::R->new({ grammar => $grammar });\n\nmy $input = '1) Foo bar: baz and qux, therefore qux (foo!) implies bar.';\n\ntry { $recce->read(\\$input) };\nwhile ($recce->pos < length $input) {\n    # ruby_slippers($recce, \\$input);\n    try   {       $recce->resume                    }  # restart at current position\n    catch { try { $recce->resume($recce->pos + 1) } }; # advance the position\n    # if both fail, we go into a new iteration of the loop.\n}\ndd $recce->value;\n\n\nWhile the same effect could be achieved with a :discard lexeme that matches anything, doing the skipping in our client code allows us to abort the parse if too much fudging had to be done.\n    ",

Please see my conclusion below\n\nEdit per comment :\n\nI understand your point that you do not want to multiply grammar rules. It is possible to be fault tolerant, except for last token. If your last token is in error, it will not be followed by anything and will never be caught in rule expression : A error.\n\nBut here is a fault tolerant parser that keeps everything except last token if case of error on that one : \n\nfrom __future__ import print_function\n\n# Tokens\ntokens = ('A', 'END')\n\nt_A   = r'A'\nt_END = r'END'\nt_ignore = \" \"\n\ndef t_error(t):\n    print(\"Illegal character '%s'\" % t.value[0])\n    t.lexer.skip(1)\n\n# Build the lexer\nimport ply.lex as lex\nlex.lex()\n\n# Rules\ndef p_statement_expr(p):\n    '''statement : expressions'''\n    # print(\"parsed:\", p[1])\n\ndef p_expressions(p):\n    '''expressions : expressions expression'''\n    p[0] = p[1] + [p[2]]\n    result.append(p[2])\n\ndef p_expressions_empty(p):\n    '''expressions : '''\n    p[0] = list()\n\ndef p_expression_pharse(p):\n    '''expression : A END\n                  | A error'''\n    p[0] = 'A'\n\ndef p_error(p):\n    if p:\n        global lasterr\n        print(\"Syntax error at '%s' (%d)\" % (p.value, p.lexpos))\n    else:\n        print(\"Syntax error at EOI\")\n\nimport ply.yacc as yacc\nyacc.yacc()\n\nwhile 1:\n    try:\n        s = input('query > ')   # use input() on Python 3\n    except EOFError:\n        break\n    result = []\n    yacc.parse(s)\n    print('Result', result)\n\n\nThe princip is to collate by expressions : expressions expression instead of expressions : expression expressions, and to keep all in a global variable.\n\nWith an input of  A END A A END A A A END it gives \n\nResult ['A', 'A', 'A', 'A', 'A', 'A']\n\n\nand with : A END A A END A A A END , it gives\n\nResult ['A', 'A', 'A', 'A', 'A']\n\n\n(all tokens but the last)\n\nWith a true flex - bison solution, it would be possible to make use of the special <<EOF>> token that matches at end of input, to always have another token after the last one. Unfortunately, it is not implemented in PLY, and the only real solution is to introduce a rule that accepts alone A token. For a real parser, it also guarantees that you are actually processing the correct token : I used\n\ndef p_expression_pharse(p):\n    '''expression : A END'''\n    p[0] = 1 + p.lexpos(1)\n\n# add a separate rule BELOW previous one to display a warning\ndef p_expression_pharse_warn(p):\n    '''expression : A'''\n    print(\"Warning at absolute position %d (line %d)\" % (p.lexpos(1), p.lineno(1)))\n    p[0] = -1 - p.lexpos(1)\n\n\nto uniquely identify tokens in resul string, and I get correct positions.\n\nAnd ... the error processing is very simple ...\n\nDiscussion TL/DR :\n\nI admit I missed the point of last token error recovery. It is because in all parsers I've seen in real use cases, the error recovery consisted in rejecting the part that was syntactically incorrect (and thus not directly useable) and re-synchonizing the parser on next correct group of token. In all what I have seen, if a partial sentence can be used, it must not be processed by the error recovery mechanizme but by a grammar rule, in which it is easy to describe the appropriate action.\n\nIf you just want to keep the offending input for later processing, I think it is not a problem of action depending of a syntax, and I would simply note the position of offending token, or at most note the position of last correctly analysed token (the end of a complete element), the begin of first error recovery token and say that what is between is incorrect.\n\nBut it would be much different than what is asked here ...\n    ",

This is difficult, as bison executes the actions immediately as it reduces the rules, so there's no good way for it to know if there might be an error in the future somewhere.  For actions after a syntax error (assuming you have error recovery rules -- it will exit after the first syntax error if you don't), you can have a global flag and simply make all actions test that flag before they do anything.\n\nIf you want to disable actions before the first error, the only thing I can think of is to have two parsers with the same grammar -- one that does no actions and one that does them.  Use the first parser to determine if there are any errors, and then rewind the input and use the second parser only if there are no errors.\n    ",

This happens, because we never want to send incomplete mailings.\n\n\n\nNow we'd like to scale up using a second server.

And everything separated by mandatory whitespace.\n\nThe best I can come up with is the following grammar:\n\ngrammar mm.ecxt.MMLanguage\n\nimport \"http://www.eclipse.org/emf/2002/Ecore\" as ecore\n\ngenerate mmLanguage \"urn:marnix:mm.exct/MMLanguage\"\n\nMMDatabase:\n    WS?

However, on invalid input, like\n\n$c class $.\n$c $.\n$c set $.\n$c x$u $.\n\n\nthere is just one error (no viable alternative at input '$.'), and after that it looks like parsing just stops: no more errors are detected, and the model just contains the correct statements before the error (here only the class statement).\n\nI tried all kinds of variations (using =>, with/without terminal declarations, enabling backtracking, and more) but all I get is no viable alternative at input ....\n\nSo my question is: How should I write a grammar for this language so that Antlr does some form of error recovery?

I was using an email template for a task at work and was curious about the HTML behind it so I loaded to code into an editor.\n\nI came across 9 separate tags that don't close: <td> <center> <div> <p> <div> <td> <tr> tbody> <table> The code starts with an <html> tag as it should, but in the <body> after a <table> and <tr>, it starts another <html> <head>... etc set of tags. In the two <style> tags, they both say say the same thing and have an extra closing brace li { margin-bottom: 10px; } }.\n\nWhen I load just this code into my browser the page still visually appears how it is supposed to. In Firebug though, after the first body tag, it skips table, tr, html, head, and body, and goes straight to just showing the first <div>.\n\nWhy is it that a webpage (because I'm sure this must be a somewhat common thing out there) that has missing closure tags, extra <html> and <body> tags, etc still able to function properly?\n    ",

However, if deployment of a revised image fails at the image pull step (say, there was a typo in the image name, so there is no image to pull), the first pod it tries to restart with the new image gets stuck in an ImagePullBackOff state and the rollover stops.  That's fine, that's pretty much what you'd want and expect.  However, if you then patch the StatefulSet spec again to correct the mistake, the set is not healed -- it just sits there in the broken state -- until you (manually) delete the failed pod, at which point everything proceeds as it should and it all works its way back to a healthy state.\n\nI'm thinking there should be a way to configure things so that this kind of recovery happens automatically when the image name is updated, just as it does for a normal deployment, rather than requiring manual intervention (especially since this is for a CI-type application, where this all needs to be automated anyway).  I can't help but feeling like I'm just not finding the right option in the documentation, but poring over the docs and doing endless Google searches hasn't revealed a winning recipe.  Is there a way to configure this kind of recovery to happen automatically, and if so, what is it?\n\nFailing that, is there a graceful way to automate detection of the failed state in order to trigger a scripted deletion of the failed pod?\n Everything I've tried seems really kludgy, with lots of polling and ad hoc timeouts, so I'm having trouble believing that's the Right Way to do it.\n    ",

In the specification, it is stated that:\n\n\n  When, as the source text is parsed from left to right, a token (called the offending token) is encountered that is\n  not allowed by any production of the grammar, then a semicolon is automatically inserted before the offending\n  token if one or more of the following conditions is true:\n  \n  \n  The offending token is separated from the previous token by at least one LineTerminator[...]\n  \n\n\nAccording to this, I'm trying to solve this problem in this naive way:\n\n\nDetect the error, using the error special token;\nTell the lexer that a syntax error occurred, during the action; if it has encountered a newline character before the current token, the lexer will return a new semicolon token at the next yylex call; at the subsequent call, it will return the token that previously was the offending one when the syntax error occurred.\n\n\nA very simplified structure of my parser is like the following:\n\nprogram:\n   stmt_list END\n;\n\nstmt_list:\n    %empty\n |  stmt_list stmt\n |  stmt_list error  { /* error detected; tell the lexer about the syntax error */ }\n;\n\nstmt:\n    value SEMICOLON\n|   [other types of statements...]\n;\n\nvalue:\n    NUMBER\n|   STRING\n;\n\n\nBut doing this way, in case the file contains a valid JavaScript statement without a terminating semicolon, but a newline character, when an offending token is encountered, the parser reduces the rest of the statement into an error special token. As I tell the lexer about the syntax error, the parser has already reduced the error token into stmt_list one and the previous valid instruction is lost, making the semicolon insertion useless.\n\nObviously I don't want to let my parser discard the valid statement and go to the next one.\n\nHow can I make this possible?

In some cases the problem occurs because the stopping condition in the \"error rule\" is not met, which in his case was because the parser was ignoring/skipping the newline ('\\n'). So the rule: \n\n\n  error '\\n' { yyerrok; yyclearin; }\n\n\nwould never work...(since '\\n' was never being captured)\n\nThus, i isolated the error between 2 known tokens to rule out this possibility yet still got the error. After investigating a bit more, i discovered the problem was inside the yyerror function which was causing the program to exit.\n    ",

Final user does not realize about this refresh on the component and there is not budget to investigate the problem.\n\nAlso I was discussing with developers if we could add something, somewhere, to indicate that the loading of the component had finished, but, again, this seems to be not possible.

    "body": "\n                \nI was going through the text Compilers: Principles,Techniques and Tools by Ullman et. al where I came across the concept of Panic mode recovery in predictive parsing. The text says about some heuristics which should be followed. But the example which they give later in the text illustrates only the points (1) and (5) of the heuristics.\n\nPanic-mode error recovery is based on the idea of skipping symbols on the the input until a token in a selected set of synchronizing tokens appears. Its effectiveness depends on the choice of synchronizing set. The sets should be chosen so that the parser recovers quickly from errors that are likely to occur in practice.\nSome heuristics are as follows:\n\nAs a starting point, we can place all symbols in FOLLOW(A) into the synchronizing set for nonterminal A. If we skip tokens until an element of FOLLOW(A) is seen and pop A from the stack, it is likely that parsing can continue.\n\nIt is not enough to use FOLLOW(A) as the synchronizing set for A. For example, if semicolons terminate statements, as in C, then keywords that begin statements may not appear in the FOLLOW set of the nonterminal generating expressions. A missing semicolon after an assignment may therefore result in the keyword beginning the next statement being skipped. Often, there is a hierarchical structure on constructs in a language; e.g., expressions appear within statements, which appear within blocks, and so on. We can add to the synchronizing set of a lower construct the symbols that begin higher constructs. For example, we might add keywords that begin statements to the synchronizing sets for the nonterminals generating expressions.\n\nIf we add symbols in FIRST(A) to the synchronizing set for nonterminal A, then it may be possible to resume parsing according to A if a symbol in FIRST(A) appears in the input.\n\nIf a nonterminal can generate the empty string, then the production deriving \\epsilon can be used as a default. Doing so may postpone some error detection, but cannot cause an error to be missed. This approach reduces the number of nonterminals that have to be considered during error recovery.\n\nIf a terminal on top of the stack cannot be matched, a simple idea is to pop the terminal, issue a message saying that the terminal was inserted, and continue parsing. In effect, this approach takes the synchronizing set of a token to consist of all other tokens.\n\n\n\nIn general I could not understand the meaning of the heuristic which is stated in point (4).\nCould anyone give me an example (or examples) where points (2), (3) , (4) could be useful. Though I could understand the meaning of all the points other than (4), but since the book does not illustrate the points (2),(3) and (4), an example would help me understand the thing better.\n    ",

Am I missing something in the grammar?\nThe DefaultErrorStrategy class is quite complex with token deletions and insertions and the book explains the theory of this class in a very good way. But what I'm missing here is how to implement custom error recovery for specific rules?\nIn my case I would add something like \"if  { is already consumed, try to find int or }\" to optimize the error recovery for this rule.\nIs this possible with ANTLR4 error recovery in a reasonable way at all?

In the FParsec attempt documentation, they say\n\nThe parser attempt p applies the parser p. If p fails after changing the parser state or with a fatal error, attempt p will backtrack to the original parser state and report a non‐fatal error.\n\nIn my case, the parser p never fails. What I'm currently implementing is an error recovery for my parser based on the approach described in this block post. This approach is to construct a parser p that never fails. Instead, it would always return a Parser<SyntaxNode,State> value, where SyntaxNode is a type for an optional parser result, and State is a list of Diagnostics. In case this list is empty, the parser p was successful.\nThe mentioned approach to error recovery in FParsec works well for simple grammars. My grammar is more complex and involves choice, attempt, or skipManyTill parsers. Since p never fails in my case, these original FParsec parses do not do the trick anymore.\nTherefore, I'm trying to write my own versions of customChoice, customAttempt, or customSkipManyTill, so that I can use them for my grammar that would also support error recovery based on the mentioned approach of parsers that never fail but emit diagnostics instead.\n    ",

The shell command line interface to the mysql server is mysql. (If you don't know how to run a shell command line, that's another problem. Also, if you're on Windows, say so, since that has its own challenges.) The arguments are:\n\nmysql -u username -ppassword databasename\n\n\nif you are running this command on the same server as mysql. Note the lack of space after the -p - that is important.\n\nSo, type the above line to invoke the command line interface to mysql. Then you can type your mysql commands. Things like show tables, desc tablename, etc., will work. That is they will work unless you have an authentication problem. But you will know you have an authentication problem because when you tried to run mysql as above, it will fail with some error, like \"Access denied for user 'abc'@'localhost' (using password: YES)\". This is a nice descriptive error message that points you exactly where the problem is.\n\nDoes that help? \n\nYou can go back to using xampp or anything else once you've made sure that you know the right parameters by checking with the command line. (Always check with the command line when strangeness happens - it's so much easier than trying to debug through other interfaces.)\n    ",

I can connect with the user I specified in the Azure portal and was able to create an additional user for testing purposes and grant it all privileges on two different databases. However, if try to do the same today I get the infamous Error Code: 1044. Access denied for user 'admin'@'%' to database 'mysql'. I have read that some MySQL versions on Azure do not support user privilege handling, but I was already able to do it with this image version. I even verified that the created user had access to the specified databases and inserting/selecting data from it was also working. I have tried setting up a fresh database with a new testuser to no avail, as i received the same error. This is basically what I did:\n\nCREATE USER 'user'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'pw';\nGRANT INSERT  ON db.* TO 'user'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'pw';\nFLUSH PRIVILEGES;\n\n\nAfter the user was created I also checked with SHOW GRANTS FOR 'user'@'%' for the given permissions and they were there. The admin user specified in the Azure portal also has grant_priv privileges. Can someone please help me to understand why all of a sudden it is not possible for me to grant even simple privileges to newly created users? It should be possible as this Blogpost from an Microsoft employee suggests. Clearly I am missing something as such a basic feature should be included.\n    ",

If that's the case, you'll need to edit the .sql file to force it to use the database name you've been assigned.\nIf that's not the case, it's likely the user you are logged in as doesn't have the privileges to create a new database, so you'll need to log in as a user that does have privileges. Perhaps you're not logged in as the user you think you are. Note that the username and host value need to match, otherwise you could be logged in as the anonymous user instead of one that has permissions (for instance, if your user account is mia with host field 127.0.0.1 but you're logged in via the socket connection to 'localhost', it doesn't match.\n    ",

The same sites worked fine on PHP5.3 with MySQL 5.5.\n\nI get similar problems when accessing MySQL via commandline (Got error: 2013: Lost connection to MySQL server at 'reading initial communication packet', system error: 102 when trying to connect), so I'm pretty sure it's not primarily a PHP7 problem.\n\nI've updated various tables (changing default dates from 0000-00-00 00:00:00 to CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, for instance) and tried tweaking some settings, but I'm a bit new at that level of detail.

            "body": "\nBased on the stack trace, it seems to be the InnoDB system tablespace that is shorter than expected. When the function dict_load_foreigns() is accessing the InnoDB system table SYS_FOREIGN or SYS_FOREIGN_COLS, it is requesting a page that is not in the buffer pool. The page read request causes InnoDB to commit suicide, because the file is too short.\n\nInnoDB notoriously does not report the problematic file name. We should refactor the I/O code in MariaDB at some point. In this case, we do know that the problem is in the InnoDB system tablespace, because the InnoDB internal SYS_ tables are located there.\n\nThere already exist some related bugs in the MariaDB tracker. I think that this scenario is already covered by these:\n\n\nMDEV-13542 Crashing on a corrupted page is unhelpful (Yes, I copied the title of the ancient MySQL Bug#10132)\nMDEV-11633 Make the InnoDB system tablespace optional (This is not going to happen soon, and the design is not finalized)\n\n\nIt would be interesting to know how the corruption occurred in the first place. Before MDEV-11556, InnoDB data file extension in MariaDB was not fully crash-safe. (MySQL does not contain this fix at all.)\n\nCould it be that the files were copied at some point? A bug in the copy procedure? Or could the system tablespace have originally consisted of multiple files, but the server was started up with the wrong innodb_data_file_path so that the last file(s) were ignored? Everything would appear fine until a page in the ‘missing’ files is being accessed.\n\nYou might ask: How to work around this error? Unfortunately, I don’t think that there currently is any way to skip the read of the foreign key metadata. So, if the metadata tables are corrupted, in the worst case you will be unable to access any InnoDB tables. For this, I would welcome a MariaDB bug report.\n    ",

I've also attempted to remove and reinstall as indicated on this thread. However, this didn't resolve the issue. I also saw a suggestion on that post to edit .Rprofile, but I either don't have this file or can't locate it. According to this post, that issue seems to have been resolved, so I'm not sure it is relevant to my issue.\nI suspect it has something to do with R and not RStudio because I installed an old version of R 3.3.3 and RStudio did not produce the error message, but I need a newer version of R to run certain packages.\nI found this similar question. I've deleted and reinstalled R and RStudio a few times now and this hasn't fixed my problem. I'm not sure what they mean by \"R Frameworks\" and don't want to delete things I am not sure about.\n    ",

Keep in mind that PowerShell distinguishes between non-terminating errors like the one above and terminating errors like you get when you execute throw 'Access denied.'.  Non terminating errors are written to stderr and logged in the $error collection but they don't stop processing of a script.  This feature is extremely handy when you are processing (say deleting or copying) a bunch of files.  You want to know which files couldn't be processed but you don't want the entire operation to stop on the first file that errors out.\n\nPowerShell also gives you the option to \"convert\" non-terminating errors to terminating errors e.g.\n\nRemove-Item c:\\file-doesnt-exist -ErrorAction Stop; \"Did I get here\"\n\n\nNotice in this case, execution stops and doesn't print out the string at the end.  Try it without the -ErrorAction Stop and you will see the error but you will also see the string \"Did I get here\".\n\nIf you want to control the Catogory info you can use the -Category parameter like so:\n\nPS> write-error \"foo\" -Category 'InvalidResult'\nwrite-error \"foo\" -Category 'InvalidResult' : foo\n    + CategoryInfo          : InvalidResult: (:) [Write-Error], WriteErrorExce..\n    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.WriteErrorException\n\n\nBut the WriteErrorException is the mechanism (I think) by which this cmdlet raises the error.

JAX-RS 1.0 is frequently provided by the com.sun.jersey:jersey* artifacts (specifically jersey-core), and JAX-RS 2.0 is provided by any of the org.glassfish.jersey.core:jersey* artifacts, or the javax.ws.rs:javax.ws.rs-api artifact, or possibly the javax:javaee-api artifact, or the jsr311-api-1.0 artifact.\n\nThe problem is that since they are different group+artifact names, maven by default will unknowingly include both 1.0 and 2.0 version jars into your final distro.\n\nFurther complicating the problem is that since there are multiple conflicting jars in the classpath, \"sometimes\" it might work, and then \"sometimes\" it might not (hence some reports of \"it worked with tomcat7, but fails with tomcat8\" etc.)\n\nFurther complicating the problem is that if you have even a single dependency that transitively depends on any of the above, then maven will bring in both versions and you're hosed.  You can find what's coming from where with mvn dependency:tree\n\nSo you have to either go to \"all 1.0\" or \"all 2.0.\"  In our case we went with all 1.0 by adding some transitive dependency exclusions to our pom.

I have also tried this with the newest version (4.3.3f1) and I am also getting the same problem.\n\n\n\nHere are the specs for my computer:\n\nCPU: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-4770k CPU @ 3.50GHz\n\nMemory: 16GB RAM\n\nOS: Windows 8.1 Pro\n\nHard drives:\n\nMain: Samsung 120GB Solid State Drive\n\nSecondary: WD 2TB Mechanical Drive x2 on RAID ONE\n\n\n\nWhen creating a new 2D project I select nothing except the 2D option and set it to be in my Mechanical Drive. First Error that appears is the following:\n\n\n  Opening file G:/Projects/....../Temp/tempfile failed: The process cannot access the file because it is being used by another process.\n      Options:\n      Try Again|Force Quit|Cancel\n\n\nI would press Try Again as nothing (not even file explorer was using that folder in anyway. It then loads up Unity with 2 errors:\n\n\n  GetPersistentManager ().WriteFile (i->path, BuildTargetSelection::NoTarget(), kDontReadObjectsFromDiskBeforeWriting)\n\n\nand \n\n\n  container.begin () == container.end ()\n  UnityEditor.HandleUtility:BeginHandles()\n\n\nThis has only started happening recently and I have created two projects before this with none of these errors using 4.2.1f. Now every time I would want to create a folder it would output the GetPersistentManager error. Unity will also not allow me to drag any assets into a folder via editor (however I am able to right click and import asset and import them that way). When I try and put the asset into the folder via file explorer i receive the following error:\n\n\n  Fatal Error! \n  GetPersistentManager().WriteFileInternal(metaDataPath, metaDataFileIndex, writeData.begin(), writeData.size(), NULL, BuildTargetSelection::NoTarget(),0)\n\n\nThe asset I imported is a sprite sheet that I have used in the previous 2 projects stated above.\n\n\n\nAs a test I have also repeated this process on my primary hard drive and it still gives me the same results.\n\nThis has become a problem as now my other two projects are having the same issues as the three errors above. If anyone has any idea what might be causing this please let me know.\n    ",

    "body": "\n                \nOur users log into the production database as a fairly low-level user, with SELECT granted at the database level, and INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE granted on the specific tables they need access to.\n\nThey also have permissions to create temporary tables (we need them for some of the more complicated queries). The problem is that whilst they can create the temporary tables, they don't have access to INSERT into them!\n\nA workaround we have found is to create a \"real\" (persistent?) table of the same name (but with only one field) and grant access for them to insert into that. Then, when the temporary table is created with the same name, the system will use that, not the persistent table.\n\nmysql> CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE `testing` (`id` INTEGER AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY, `name` VARCHAR(30));\nQuery OK, 0 rows affected (0.04 sec)\nmysql> INSERT INTO `testing` (`name`) VALUES ('testing');\nERROR 1142 (42000): INSERT command denied to user 'stduser'@'office.companyname.co.uk' for table 'testing'\n\n\nIf you try to grant access to the table (in another session, as root), you can't:\n\nmysql> GRANT INSERT ON testdb.testing TO 'stduser'@'%';\nERROR 1146 (42S02): Table 'testdb.testing' doesn't exist\n\n\nSo my question is, basically, can we grant INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE on temporary tables without having a \"persistent\" table of the same name hanging around?\n    ",

A small number of the tables are for internationalisation purposes:\n\nTransLanguage - non-English languages\n\nTransModule - modules (bundles of phrases for translation, that can be loaded individually by PHP scripts)\n\nTransPhrase - individual phrases, in English, for potential translation\n\nTranslatedPhrase - translations of phrases that are submitted by volunteers\n\nChosenTranslatedPhrase - screened translations of phrases.\n\nThe volunteers who do translation are all working on the production site, as they are regular users.\n\nI wanted to create a stored procedure that could be used to synchronise the contents of four of these tables - TransLanguage, TransModule, TransPhrase and ChosenTranslatedPhrase - from the production database to the testing database, so as to keep the test environment up-to-date and prevent \"unknown phrase\" errors from being in the way while testing. My first effort was to create the following procedure in the test database:\n\nCREATE PROCEDURE `SynchroniseTranslations` ()\nLANGUAGE SQL\nNOT DETERMINISTIC\nMODIFIES SQL DATA\nSQL SECURITY DEFINER\nBEGIN\n\nDELETE FROM `TransLanguage`;\n\nDELETE FROM `TransModule`;\n\nINSERT INTO `TransLanguage` SELECT * FROM `PRODUCTION_DB`.`TransLanguage`;\n\nINSERT INTO `TransModule` SELECT * FROM `PRODUCTION_DB`.`TransModule`;\n\nINSERT INTO `TransPhrase` SELECT * FROM `PRODUCTION_DB`.`TransPhrase`;\n\nINSERT INTO `ChosenTranslatedPhrase` SELECT * FROM `PRODUCTION_DB`.`ChosenTranslatedPhrase`;\n\nEND\n\n\nWhen I try to run this, I get an error message: \"SELECT command denied to user 'username'@'localhost' for table 'TransLanguage'\". I also tried to create the procedure to work the other way around (that is, to exist as part of the data dictionary for the production database rather than the test database). If I do it that, way, I get an identical message except it tells me I'm denied the DELETE command rather than SELECT.\n\nI have made sure that my user has INSERT, DELETE, SELECT, UPDATE and CREATE ROUTINE privileges on both databases. However, it seems as though MySQL is reluctant to let this user exercise its privileges on both databases at the same time. How come, and is there a way around this?\n    ",

Because of the collation type the database cannot have UTF8 characters inside so the comparism should work event though this changes the original string (converting UTF8 characters that are not existend in the ISO charset result in a ? or these are removed entirely).

        "Interesting code. I would not deploy a function that ran a C compiler in a production environment - it is both slow and 'unreliable' in that some people don't have compilers at run time. There is ample opportunity for caching results on the assumption that the set of error messages doesn't normally change except (perhaps) when the operating system is upgraded, and even then backwards compatibility means that most error numbers remain unchanged. You could use your code, though, to collect the data for all the system errors and then use that output in function driven from data at compile time.",

            "body": "\nI recently wrote errnoname to do this.\nThere is unfortunately still no standard API to do this. (GNU's glibc has strerrorname_np, but no other C library currently provides it, so it's not even available on all Linux distros, let alone anywhere else.)\nI try to keep it portable to all systems while covering all errno names on that system. So far that includes Linux, Darwin (macOS, iOS, etc), BSD (FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, etc), several closed-source Unixes, Windows, and a few others.\nThe only \"hard\" part is getting the list of errno names and values to do the lookups, knowing which errno are even defined on the target system, and exhaustively handling all cases where multiple errno names might map to the same number. (For example, EWOULDBLOCK is equal to EAGAIN on some systems.)\nSo in my errnoname library you don't have to deal with any of that. I collect the errno names for many operating systems into a list as a separate step, then I generate the actual released C code from that. The C code uses #ifdef for each name, so it can compile on any system regardless of which errno names and values that system has. The compiled result is just simple and efficient code that doesn't have to call any programs or search for errno in library headers.\nI also give you the option to compile it as either an array lookup or as a switch, since errno value are not guaranteed to be even close to contiguous, but on many system are contiguous enough to make an array lookup far better. (Although good modern compilers can automatically notice when it would be better to turn a switch into an array lookup.)\nAnyway, since it is released under the \"Zero-Clause BSD license\" (0BSD), which is a permissive license, or more accurately a public-domain-equivalent license, you can do whatever you want with it.\nBelow is an old copy-paste of the function from my library, so that this answer is useful even if my repo link ever goes dead, but beware:\n\nThe copy here only covers all errno names I could find as of start of August 2019 - I have found many others since then.\n\nI will keep updating the library to include errno names as I find them and as systems add them, add other improvements, and add duplicate protections as possible duplicates are discovered. But I will not (and last I checked, cannot, due to size limits on the answer) keep this answer's copy updated.\n\n\n#include <errno.h>\n\nchar const * errnoname(int errno_)\n{\n    switch(errno_)\n

I'll assume that it should not show any error if the 'Authority# (Alpha)' is not entered for that scenario.\nThere could be better solution out there but here's the approach that I use in my projects. You can put this block after form initialization so the form already has these auth type and auth number controls to access:\nthis.addAuthorityForm.get('authTypeName').valueChanges.subscribe((newValue) => {\n    const authNumber = this.addAuthorityForm.get('authNumber');\n\n    // I don't know the exact structure of the authTypeName so you can debug and change the condition if needed\n    if (newValue === 'EWO') { \n        authNumber.setValidators([Validators.required, Validators.maxLength(20), Validators.pattern(this.alphabeticRegex)]);\n    } else {\n        authNumber.setValidators([Validators.maxLength(20), Validators.pattern(this.alphabeticRegex)]);\n    }\n    authNumber.updateValueAndValidity();\n})\n\nBasically, what this does is reassign the validators for the auth number when the auth type change by adding the required validators. I use Validators.required because it's provided out of the box but if you want to make it more custom, you can have something like this:\n...\nauthNumber.setValidators([(c: FormControl) => {\n    return c.value ? null : {required: {valid: false}};\n}, Validators.maxLength(20), Validators.pattern(this.alphabeticRegex)]);\n...\n\nThe updateValueAndValidity method is to revalidate the field when user switches the auth type.\n    ",

As we has the \"control\", in control.parent\" we has the \"form\", so it's so easy like\n  requiredIf(requiredValue:string){\n    return (control:FormControl)=>{\n      const form=control.parent;\n      if (form)\n      {\n        //really we need decalre controlDescription, it's the\n        //same of \"control\"\n        const controlDescription=form.get('authDescription')\n        const controlTypeName=form.get('authTypeName')\n        if (controlTypeName && controlDescription && \n            controlTypeName.value==requiredValue && !controlDescription.value)\n           return {required:true}\n      }\n      return null\n    }\n  }\n\nAnd we can write\n  form=new FormGroup({\n    authDescription:new FormControl(null,this.requiredIf('EWO')),\n    authTypeName:new FormControl('EWO')\n  })\n\nSee that the value 'EWO' is fixed when declare the formGroup\nthe new stackblitz\n    ",

The input calls a JSON object as a response.\n{ name: 'Paul', id: 1 }\n\nAt this point a need to show [name], when selected on the select option, in the input. And set the option value to [id].\nNo problem, I've done with.\n\n[displayWith]=\"displayFn\"\n\nThat's ok, everything works as should, but I don't know how to validate the [id] as a number. Every time I've tried it just validate the input [name] as a string.\nWhy I need that? So, I will use just the [id] to build the form object [ownerId].\n\r\n\r\n<input id=\"ownerId\" type=\"text\" matInput formControlName=\"ownerId\" [matAutocomplete]=\"auto\" placeholder=\"Digite para pesquisar...\" name=\"doNotAutocomplete\" autocomplete=\"doNotAutoComplete\" required>\n<mat-autocomplete autoActiveFirstOption #auto=\"matAutocomplete\" [displayWith]=\"displayFn\">\n  <mat-option *ngFor=\"let option of owners\" [value]=\"option\">\n      {{option.name}}\n  </mat-option>\n</mat-autocomplete>\n<mat-error>Selecione ou cadastre um novo proprietário.</mat-error>\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n    // Set display owner name on input form - id on value\n    displayFn(owner: Owner): any {\n        return owner && owner.name ? owner.name : '';\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n        // Horizontal Stepper form steps\n        this.formGroup = this.formBuilder.group({\n            formArray: this.formBuilder.array([\n                this.formBuilder.group({\n                    ownerId: ['', [Validators.required],\n                    code: ['', Validators.required],\n                    agent: ['', Validators.required]\n                }),\r\n\r\n\r\n\nThe mat-error is setting the input INVALID when the name is selected from the input.\nMany thanks for any help.\n    ",

Here's the part of the code causing the problem:\n\n        with open(filename, 'rt') as f:\n            reader = csv.reader(f, delimiter=',')\n            lines = []\n            if sum(1 for row in reader) < len(players):\n                f.seek(0)\n                for row in reader:\n                    row_len = len(row)\n                line = []\n                for i in range(row_len):\n                    line.append('')\n                f.seek(0)\n                for i in range(len(players) + 1 - sum(1 for row in reader)):\n                    lines.append(line)\n            f.seek(0)\n            title = next(reader)\n            counter = 0\n            for line in reader:\n                lines.insert(0, line)\n\n\nI can include surrounding code if it would be useful. The error says the problem occurs on the very first line in the code above. Why would I be getting this error on my ec2 Ubuntu server but not on my local windows machine?\n    ",

It is about the generator creation so could be some file IO problem, so check it twice, if all image exists in the path it needs, though from thr PIL code I see, that PIL is about to handle such problem specifically. So hard to say, maybe some other guy met with it. Whose version did you change tensorflow or cuda or both? Anyway you aligned tensorflow and cuda, but the error comes from PIL, so it could be some compatibility issue between keras and PIL as well.",

    "title": "AbstractMethodError when calling overridden method of abstract class from a class compiled at runtime",
    "body": "\n                \nLet me first summarize what exactly I'm trying to do. Basically, I'm using the JavaCompiler package to compile a class at runtime that extends my superclass \"Player\". The only thing that I know will be in the subclass is that it will extend Player and override the abstract method calcMove(). To load the class at runtime after it has been compiled, I create a URIclassloader object to load the class file after it has been created. The problem is that when I try to run the calcMove method from the instantiated object (by using java.lang.reflect)\n\nHere's bascially what I'm doing:\n\n//to hold the compiler output\nByteArrayOutputStream compilerOut = new ByteArrayOutputStream();\n\n                //compile\nJavaCompiler compiler = ToolProvider.getSystemJavaCompiler();\n\nint compilationResult = compiler.run(null, compilerOut, compilerOut, playerFile.getAbsolutePath());\n\nif (compilationResult == 0) {\n\nSystem.out.println(\"File \" + playerFile.getName() + \" compiled successfully\");\n\n} else {\n\n//code 99 as compile error\nSystem.err.println(compilerOut.toString());\nSystem.exit(99);\n}\n\n\nOnce the file is compiled, I use this code to make a uriclassloader to load the class (the upload folder contains the source and class files) The className is determined from the file name. Then I use java Reflection to instantiate the class as an object and cast it as a Player:\n\nURL classUrl = new File(\"upload\").toURI().toURL();\n\nClassLoader classLoader = URLClassLoader.newInstance(new URL[]{classUrl}, ClassLoader.getSystemClassLoader());\n                classLoader.loadClass(className).asSubclass(Player.class);\n\nClass<?> studentCustomClass = Class.forName(className, true, classLoader);\n\n\nConstructor<?> constructor = studentCustomClass.getConstructor();\nPlayer studentPlayer = (Player) constructor.newInstance()\n\n\nThe instantiation apparently works until I get to where it calls calcMove. I create a new \"Game\" class that takes 2 Player arguments, within this Game class I call the calcMove() method from the custom class objects (cast as Players). However I'm getting an AbstractMethodError Exception because its trying to call the abstract calcMove method from Player instead of the implemented version from the subclass.\n\nSo, I'm wondering, is there some reason why it's trying to call the abstract version from the parent class instead of the version from the class I just compiled? (As far as I can tell, java considers the object I create to be a type of the subclass class rather than just a Player class , which I couldn't instantiate anyway since its abstract) Right now I'm using java Reflection to force it to call the calcMove fucntion from the object\n\nMethod calcmove = players[0].getClass().getMethod(\"calcMove\");\n\ncalcmove.invoke(players[0]);\n\n\nI'd like to avoid using reflect at this point in the code for security reasons. So why does this work, but this:\n\nplayers[0].calcMove();\n\n\nGives me an AbstractClassError?\n    ",

I always get the error\n\nError in processing request: #2006 MySQL server has gone away\n\nI can create new databases without a problem, and I can install, for example Joomla 3.1.1 with no problems.\n\nHowever, when I try to install a new extension into my Joomla installation, I get errors. For example, I get the following error when I try to install a component from NoNumber:\n\n1062 Duplicate entry '1' for key 'PRIMARY' SQL=INSERT INTO `u5z87_extensions` (`name`,`type`,`element`,`folder`,`client_id`,`enabled`,`access`) VALUES ('plg_system_nnframework','plugin','nnframework','system','0','1','1')\n\n\nSame thing for many other extensions.\n\nI tried to start mysql with\n\nmysql.server start --log-warnings=2\n\nand it started with no problem\n\nStarting MySQL\n SUCCESS!\n\n\nI looked up issues where error #2006 were being reported and how to solve them, and they referred to modifying /etc/my.cnf but there is no /etc/my.cnf configuration file on my system, and there wasn't one in the previous installation of MySQL 5.5.29 (also installed with homebrew) and I had no problems.\n\nI ran brew doctor and the output is below\n\n$ brew doctor\nWarning: \"config\" scripts exist outside your system or Homebrew directories.\n`./configure` scripts often look for *-config scripts to determine if\nsoftware packages are installed, and what additional flags to use when\ncompiling and linking.\n\nHaving additional scripts in your path can confuse software installed via\nHomebrew if the config script overrides a system or Homebrew provided\nscript of the same name. We found the following \"config\" scripts:\n\n    /usr/local/opt/php54/bin/php-config\n\n\nThe output from brew --config is also below:\n\n$ brew --config\nHOMEBREW_VERSION: 0.9.4\nORIGIN: https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew\nHEAD: 86ce842c700a47abdc354e80cc3b0b3938ab2132\nHOMEBREW_PREFIX: /usr/local\nHOMEBREW_CELLAR: /usr/local/Cellar\nCPU: 8-core 64-bit nehalem\nOS X: 10.8.3-x86_64\nXcode: 4.6.2\nCLT: 4.6.0.0.1.1365549073\nLLVM-GCC: build 2336\nClang: 4.2 build 425\nX11: 2.7.4 => /opt/X11\nSystem Ruby: 1.8.7-358\nPerl: /usr/bin/perl\nPython: /usr/bin/python\nRuby: /Users/alisamii/.rvm/rubies/ruby-1.9.3-p374/bin/ruby\n\n\nExploring a little further, I tried to revert to my previous install of MySQL using\n\nbrew switch mysql 5.5.29\n\nThis resulted in the following output:\n\n$ brew switch mysql 5.5.29\nCleaning /usr/local/Cellar/mysql/5.5.29\nCleaning /usr/local/Cellar/mysql/5.6.10\n135 links created for /usr/local/Cellar/mysql/5.5.29\n\n\nI then accessed mysql from the command line and ran status:\n\nmysql> status\n--------------\nmysql  Ver 14.14 Distrib 5.5.29, for osx10.8 (i386) using readline 5.1\n\nConnection id:      13\nCurrent database:\nCurrent user:       alisamii@localhost\nSSL:            Not in use\nCurrent pager:      stdout\nUsing outfile:      ''\nUsing delimiter:        ;\nServer version:     5.6.10 Source distribution\nProtocol version:       10\nConnection:         Localhost via UNIX socket\nServer characterset:    utf8\nDb     characterset:    utf8\nClient characterset:    utf8\nConn.  characterset:    utf8\nUNIX socket:        /tmp/mysql.sock\nUptime:         1 hour 56 min 24 sec\n\n\nAs you can see above, it reports mysql Ver 14.14 Distrib 5.5.29, for osx10.8 (i386) using readline 5.1\n\nBut, it also says Server version:      5.6.10 Source distribution\n\nSo something isn't syncing up.\n\nFurthermore, when I show databases, I get the following output:\n\nmysql> show databases\n    -> ;\n+--------------------+\n| Database           |\n+--------------------+\n| information_schema |\n+--------------------+\n1 row in set (0.00 sec)\n\n\nBut I know I have more than just an information_schema database.\n\n\n\nSo, somehow, it seems to me that mysql is not connecting to the right server, as phpmyadmin reports the same server information that mysql's status command reports: Software version: 5.6.10 - Source distribution.\n\nAt this point, I am completely lost, and would really need some help.\n    ",

    "title": "Possible reasons for \"mysql server has gone away\" error (php 5.4, mysqlnd)",
    "body": "\n                \nWe recently upgraded one of our webservers from PHP 5.3 (Debian Squeeze package, using libmysqlclient and APC) to PHP 5.4 (Debian Wheezy, Dotdeb package, using mysqlnd, Opcache and APCu). After working fine for almost one day, we experienced \"mysql server has gone away\" errors for every request. All other servers with the same load which still run PHP 5.3 with libmysqlclient using the same MySQL server had no problem at all. On all servers we use:\n\nmax_execution_time = 60\ndefault_socket_timeout = 60\n\n\nOn our PHP 5.3 servers we did not change any mysql/my.cnf timeouts. We know about problems with read_timeout (mysql), wait_timeout (mysql), default_socket_timeout (php) and max_execution_time (php), but only in context of batch scripts with long running queries. Our webservers usually respond in about 300ms, so those timeouts should not be an issue here.\n\nIt became really strange when we removed the server from loadbalancing, so there was no load anymore, but we still had 180 busy Apache processes. Even a apache2ctl graceful did not change anything, even hours later apache2ctl status said:\n\n                       Apache Server Status for localhost\n\n   Server Version: Apache/2.2.22 (Debian)\n   Server Built: Jun 16 2014 03:51:14\n     __________________________________________________________________\n\n   Current Time: Tuesday, 22-Jul-2014 10:17:44 CEST\n   Restart Time: Monday, 21-Jul-2014 18:43:37 CEST\n   Parent Server Generation: 26\n   Server uptime: 15 hours 34 minutes 6 seconds\n   Total accesses: 596973 - Total Traffic: 1.6 GB\n   CPU Usage: u6288.72 s463.96 cu.01 cs0 - 12% CPU load\n   10.7 requests/sec - 30.8 kB/second - 2962 B/request\n   176 requests currently being processed, 99 idle workers\n\nGGGGGG_GGGGGGGGG_GG_GGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG_GGGGGG_GGGGGGGG_GGGGGGG\nGGGGGGGGGG_G_GGGGGGGG_G_GG__GGGGGG_GGGGG_GGG___GG_GGGGGGGG_G_GGG\nGGGGGGGGGGGG_G_GG__GG_GGG_GGGGGGGGG__GGG_GGG_G_G_GG_G_GGGGGGGGGG\nGGG_GGG_GG_GGG_GG_G_GGG_______________.___._W___________________\n____.___________.______.........................................\n................................................................\n................................................................\n................................................................\n................................................................\n................................................................\n................................................................\n................................................................\n................................................................\n................................................................\n................................................................\n................................................................\n................................................................\n................................................................\n................................................................\n................................................................\n................................................................\n................................................................\n................................................................\n................................................................\n................................................................\n................................................................\n................................................................\n................................................................\n................................................................\n................................................................\n................................................................\n................................................................\n................................................................\n................................................................\n................................................................\n................................................................\n................................................................\n................................................................\n................................................................\n....\n\n   Scoreboard Key:\n   \"_\" Waiting for Connection, \"S\" Starting up, \"R\" Reading Request,\n   \"W\" Sending Reply, \"K\" Keepalive (read), \"D\" DNS Lookup,\n   \"C\" Closing connection, \"L\" Logging, \"G\" Gracefully finishing,\n   \"I\" Idle cleanup of worker, \".\" Open slot with no current process\n\n\nOnly apache2ctl restart solved the issue and everything worked fine again. The MySQL error is the only \"useful\" error message we found so far.\n\nCould it be an issue with mysqlnd, opcache or apcu and PHP 5.4.30? Are there any known problems which could result in the behavior we have experienced?\n\nOr do you have an idea how to debug the \"mysql server has gone away\" issue?\n    ",

So under certain conditions something seems to take more than 30 seconds while we are reading a result-set from MySQL, so the server closes the connection while we are still trying to get data from the server. That leads us to the next questions:\n\n\nWhat function consumes so much time while we are in a loop reading a result-set from mysql?\nWhy does apache2ctl graceful not restart the Apache Processes, even when max_execution_time should abort the scripts after 60 seconds?\n\n\nI think the answer to both questions is a bug in APCu. Because if I look at the hanging Apache childs, I get FUTEX_WAIT from strace:\n\n[pid 28354] futex(0x7f3a8c3d2094, FUTEX_WAIT, 69, NULL <unfinished ...>\n\n\nIf I look at such a process using gdb it seems to hang at pthread_rwlock_wrlock(), what I get is: \n\n0x00007f3adcd18abd in pthread_rwlock_wrlock () from /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpthread.so.0\n\n\nOK, pthread_rwlock is used for locking in APCu, and problems with locking mechanism is a really good explanation for what we see here, in that we definitely have code which reads/writes to APCu inside of loops through MySQL result-sets, and if there is a problem with locking (which already has been a problem for us in the past with APC as well) it could take >30 and <60 seconds so the MySQL error is what we see. And after that situation something with APCu goes really wrong, so the php script can't be aborted by max_execution_time and not be restarted by apache2ctl graceful anymore. \n\nIn APCu issue tracker I could find very similar issues:\nhttps://github.com/krakjoe/apcu/issues/19\n\nBut we found another hint. The crash always happens, when there are about 70k keys in APCu, and it does not depend on apc.shm_size, but we found out that our APCu monitoring script produces \"PHP Fatal error:  Allowed memory size of 134217728 bytes exhausted (tried to allocate 78 bytes)\" errors when calling apcu_cache_info() at line 47 at the same time when we see the crash. So we have to look into the script why it consumes so much memory, AFAIR id read's all the data for calculating memory fragmentation, perhaps we should remove that part...\n\nBut we had a lot of problems with APC in the past, we switched to APCu/Opcache only because we got seg faults with latest APC and PHP 5.4.30 and the issue mentioned above is open for one year now. We are happy to see recent activity on yac, perhaps lockless is a more stable option. If we can't fix by removing problems from our monitoring script, we will switch to local memcached instances, it will be slower but we know it's very stable.\n    ",

To give you an example:\n\nfunction foo {\n    Param([string]$Msg = \"This is an error\")\n    Write-Error $Msg\n}\n\n\nCalling foo results in the following:\n\nfoo: This is an error\nAt line:1 char:1\n+ foo\n\nSo, it seems that calling foo (and the cmdlet Write-Error therein), throws an error that PS links to the function foo itself.\n\nWhat would be the correct way to write a message into the PS error stream but without having it look like an error in the calling function?\n\nI found the answer: The difference is a bit subtle: There is a difference between throwing an error and outputting error messages to the standard error stream. In a try/catch structure throwing an error would jump into the catch block. While using write-error in the try block would just pipe the output into the standard error stream. The following function will not go into the catch block. However, it writes an error message \"Hey\" into the $error variable and leaves all other attributes empty.\n\nfunction myErr { try { write-error \"Hey\" } catch { write-host \"Ups\" } }\n\n\nThe error message, however, will show that the error occurred in myErr at line 1, char 1.\n\nSo okay, I see that this seems to be the standard behavior when calling write-error.

There are many ways to tokenise a sentence, the most straightforward way is to convert a sentence to a list of words. E.g. I want to change my credit card becomes [I, want, to, change, my, credit, card]. Another way is to roll a window of size n across your sentence, e.g. I want to becomes ['I w', ' wa', 'wan', 'ant', ...] for window size 3.\nAfter tokenising your sentence, create an embedding (vectorising), i.e. convert your token to a vector of numbers. The most simple way is to use some ready-made library like sklearn's TfidfVectorizer. If your data cares about the order of the words, then a more sophisticated vectoriser is needed.\nAfter vectorising, use a clustering algorithm. The most simple one is K-Means.\n\nOf course, this is a very complicated task, and there could be a lot of ways to approach this problem. What I described is the simplest out-of-the-box solution. Some clever people have used different strategies to get better results. One example is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlKE4gvJjMo. You need to do this research on this field on your own.\nEdit: of course your approach is good for a small dataset.

You can change root to the user you want to login with:\nmysql -u root -p\n\nEnter your mysql root password\nNext, list out all the users and their host on the MySQL server. Unlike PostgreSQL this is often stored in the mysql database. So we need to select the mysql database first:\nuse mysql;\nSELECT user, host FROM user;\n\nNote: if you don't run the use mysql, you get the no database selected error.\nThis should give you an output of this sort:\n+------------------+-----------+\n| user             | host      |\n+------------------+-----------+\n| mysql.infoschema | localhost |\n| mysql.session    | localhost |\n| mysql.sys        | localhost |\n| root             | localhost |\n+------------------+-----------+\n4 rows in set (0.00 sec)\n\nNext, based on the information gotten from the list, grant privileges to the user that you want. We will need to first select the database before granting permission to it. For me, I am using the root user that runs on the localhost host:\nuse my_app_db;\nGRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'root'@'localhost';\n\nNote: The GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON database_name.* TO 'root'@'localhost'; command may not work for modern versions of MySQL. Most modern versions of MyQL replace the database_name with * in the grant privileges command after you select the database that you want to use.\nYou can then exit the MySQL console:\nexit\n\nThat's it.\nI hope this helps\n    ",

Since the ANALYZE takes a long time, the connection used while this is running is locked down.

    "title": "MySQL stored procedure fails on second call on same connection with \"SELECT command denied to user 'user'@'localhost' for table 'view_name'",
    "body": "\n                \nI have a table called sales_observation_daily_summary which is a materialized view of sales_observation_daily_summary_view.  I have defined a stored procedure called sync_daily_summary_view_with_table that will refresh the materialized view.  Functionally, it works exactly as I expect.  However, I have a strange bug when calling the stored procedure twice on the same connection (a likely scenario when using a connection pool).  Originally this came up in my Java integration tests, but I am able to reproduce it on MySQL Workbench easily, so it shouldn't have anything to do with JDBC or Spring or anything in the middle like that.\n\ncall sync_daily_summary_view_with_table();\ncall sync_daily_summary_view_with_table();\n\n\nOn the first call, it does what it's supposed to do and returns normally.  On the second call, I get:\n\nError Code: 1142\nSELECT command denied to user 'test'@'localhost' for table 'one_pg_someone_sales_observation_daily_summary_view'\n\n\none_pg_someone_sales_observation_daily_summary_view is referenced in sales_observation_daily_summary_view, which is referenced in the stored procedure.  The error message makes no sense as first of all, stored procedure did not object the first time it was run and second of all, that user has plenty of rights to select on that view.\n\nI won't show all of the views involved as it is very complex, but the sales_observation_daily_summary_view is defined as a union of several other views thus:\n\nCREATE ALGORITHM=UNDEFINED

No.\nStop fooling around and login as root:\n\nC:\\Users\\Charity>mysql -u root -p\nEnter password: **********\nmysql> select user();\n+----------------+\n| user()         |\n+----------------+\n| root@localhost |\n+----------------+\n1 row in set (0.00 sec)\nmysql>\n\n\nNow you are root, you can see everything.\nLook at the mysql.user table:\n\nmysql> select user, host from mysql.user;\n+------+-----------+\n| user | host      |\n+------+-----------+\n|      | linux     |\n| root | linux     |\n|      | localhost |\n| pma  | localhost |\n| root | localhost |\n+------+-----------+\n5 rows in set (0.00 sec)\n\n\nYou might want to create more users so you can let people use the database without giving them the rights to do anything to your database.  Keep the barbarians out at the moat.\nYou don't want to be logging in as root all the time.  So create a new user.  Go to phpmyadmin, login to phpadmin as root.  Click the \"users\" tab and create a new user.  A new dialog shows, fill in the username, password and permissions.  Then you can login as that user:\n\nC:\\Users\\Charity>mysql -u el -p\nEnter password: **********\nmysql> select user();\n+----------------+\n| user()         |\n+----------------+\n| el@localhost   |\n+----------------+\n1 row in set (0.00 sec)\nmysql>\n\n\nThis user can do everything that you granted in the permissions defined in step 7.\n\n    ",

            "body": "\n                \nData Storage:\n\nSpecify the utf8mb4 character set on all tables and text columns in your database.  This makes MySQL physically store and retrieve values encoded natively in UTF-8.\n\nNote that simply changing charset on a table (alter table test charset utf8mb4;) won't change the charset of the table columns. alter table test CONVERT TO charset utf8mb4; has to be using instead.\nNote that MySQL will implicitly use utf8mb4 encoding if a utf8mb4_* collation is specified (without any explicit character set).\n\n\nIn older versions of MySQL (< 5.5.3), you'll unfortunately be forced to use simply utf8, which only supports a subset of Unicode characters.  I wish I were kidding.\n\n\nData Access:\n\nIn your application code (e.g. PHP), in whatever DB access method you use, you'll need to set the connection charset to utf8mb4.  This way, MySQL does no conversion from its native UTF-8 when it hands data off to your application and vice versa.\n\nSome drivers provide their own mechanism for configuring the connection character set, which both updates its own internal state and informs MySQL of the encoding to be used on the connection—this is usually the preferred approach.   In PHP:\n\nIf you're using the PDO abstraction layer with PHP ≥ 5.3.6, you can specify charset in the DSN:\n $dbh = new PDO('mysql:charset=utf8mb4');\n\n\nIf you're using mysqli, you can call set_charset():\n  $mysqli->set_charset('utf8mb4');       // object oriented style\n  mysqli_set_charset($link, 'utf8mb4');  // procedural style\n\n\nIf you're stuck with plain mysql but happen to be running PHP ≥ 5.2.3, you can call mysql_set_charset.\n\n\n\nIf the driver does not provide its own mechanism for setting the connection character set, you may have to issue a query to tell MySQL how your application expects data on the connection to be encoded: SET NAMES 'utf8mb4'.\n\nThe same consideration regarding utf8mb4/utf8 applies as above.\n\n\nOutput:\n\nUTF-8 should be set in the HTTP header, such as Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8. You can achieve that either by setting default_charset in php.ini (preferred), or manually using header() function.\nIf your application transmits text to other systems, they will also need to be informed of the character encoding.  With web applications, the browser must be informed of the encoding in which data is sent (through HTTP response headers or HTML metadata).\nWhen encoding the output using json_encode(), you may want to add JSON_UNESCAPED_UNICODE as a second parameter to avoid using the JSON Unicode escaping.\n\nInput:\n\nBrowsers will submit data in the character set specified for the document, hence nothing particular has to be done on the input.\nIn case you have doubts about request encoding (in case it could be tampered with), you may verify every received string as being valid UTF-8 before you try to store it or use it anywhere.  PHP's mb_check_encoding() does the trick, but you have to use it religiously.  There's really no way around this, as malicious clients can submit data in whatever encoding they want, and I haven't found a trick to get PHP to do this for you reliably.\n\nOther Code Considerations:\n\nObviously enough, all files you'll be serving (PHP, HTML, JavaScript, etc.) should be encoded in valid UTF-8.\n\nYou need to make sure that every time you process a UTF-8 string, you do so safely.  This is, unfortunately, the hard part.  You'll probably want to make extensive use of PHP's mbstring extension.\n\nPHP's built-in string operations are not by default UTF-8 safe.

PHP considers \"characters\" to be 1 byte long. Sometimes this is okay (for example, explode() only looks for a byte sequence and uses it as a separator -- so it doesn't matter what actual characters you look for). But other times, when the function is actually designed to work on characters, PHP has no idea that your text has multi-byte characters that are found with Unicode.\nA good library to check into is phputf8. This rewrites all of the \"bad\" functions so you can safely work on UTF8 strings. There are extensions like the mb_string extension that try to do this for you, too, but I prefer using the library because it's more portable (but I write mass-market products, so that's important for me).

    "selected_answer": "\n                \nData Storage:\n\nSpecify the utf8mb4 character set on all tables and text columns in your database.  This makes MySQL physically store and retrieve values encoded natively in UTF-8.\n\nNote that simply changing charset on a table (alter table test charset utf8mb4;) won't change the charset of the table columns. alter table test CONVERT TO charset utf8mb4; has to be using instead.\nNote that MySQL will implicitly use utf8mb4 encoding if a utf8mb4_* collation is specified (without any explicit character set).\n\n\nIn older versions of MySQL (< 5.5.3), you'll unfortunately be forced to use simply utf8, which only supports a subset of Unicode characters.  I wish I were kidding.\n\n\nData Access:\n\nIn your application code (e.g. PHP), in whatever DB access method you use, you'll need to set the connection charset to utf8mb4.  This way, MySQL does no conversion from its native UTF-8 when it hands data off to your application and vice versa.\n\nSome drivers provide their own mechanism for configuring the connection character set, which both updates its own internal state and informs MySQL of the encoding to be used on the connection—this is usually the preferred approach.   In PHP:\n\nIf you're using the PDO abstraction layer with PHP ≥ 5.3.6, you can specify charset in the DSN:\n $dbh = new PDO('mysql:charset=utf8mb4');\n\n\nIf you're using mysqli, you can call set_charset():\n  $mysqli->set_charset('utf8mb4');       // object oriented style\n  mysqli_set_charset($link, 'utf8mb4');  // procedural style\n\n\nIf you're stuck with plain mysql but happen to be running PHP ≥ 5.2.3, you can call mysql_set_charset.\n\n\n\nIf the driver does not provide its own mechanism for setting the connection character set, you may have to issue a query to tell MySQL how your application expects data on the connection to be encoded: SET NAMES 'utf8mb4'.\n\nThe same consideration regarding utf8mb4/utf8 applies as above.\n\n\nOutput:\n\nUTF-8 should be set in the HTTP header, such as Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8. You can achieve that either by setting default_charset in php.ini (preferred), or manually using header() function.\nIf your application transmits text to other systems, they will also need to be informed of the character encoding.  With web applications, the browser must be informed of the encoding in which data is sent (through HTTP response headers or HTML metadata).\nWhen encoding the output using json_encode(), you may want to add JSON_UNESCAPED_UNICODE as a second parameter to avoid using the JSON Unicode escaping.\n\nInput:\n\nBrowsers will submit data in the character set specified for the document, hence nothing particular has to be done on the input.\nIn case you have doubts about request encoding (in case it could be tampered with), you may verify every received string as being valid UTF-8 before you try to store it or use it anywhere.  PHP's mb_check_encoding() does the trick, but you have to use it religiously.  There's really no way around this, as malicious clients can submit data in whatever encoding they want, and I haven't found a trick to get PHP to do this for you reliably.\n\nOther Code Considerations:\n\nObviously enough, all files you'll be serving (PHP, HTML, JavaScript, etc.) should be encoded in valid UTF-8.\n\nYou need to make sure that every time you process a UTF-8 string, you do so safely.  This is, unfortunately, the hard part.  You'll probably want to make extensive use of PHP's mbstring extension.\n\nPHP's built-in string operations are not by default UTF-8 safe.  There are some things you can safely do with normal PHP string operations (like concatenation), but for most things you should use the equivalent mbstring function.\n\nTo know what you're doing (read: not mess it up), you really need to know UTF-8 and how it works on the lowest possible level.

The key problem here is that when you #include <cstring> you get all the identifiers from the standard C header <string.h>, declared in namespace std. In addition, you might (and probably will) get all those names in the global namespace as well.

    "body": "\n                \nI've found Zed Shaw's debug macros on his website when his C book \"Learn C the Hard Way\" was free to read. It was designed for Linux initially, and it works pretty well, been using it for a while.\n\nNow, I've started to write C code for Windows and I'm using Visual Studio. I want to use these debug macros in a project I'm working on.\n\nThe problem is as follows:\nLet's say I want to use the check macro to make sure a function returned without error.\n\ndisplay = al_create_display(640, 480);\ncheck(display, \"Failed to create display\");\n\n\nThe definition for the macros that will be used are the following:\n\n#define clean_errno() (errno == 0 ? \"None\" : strerror(errno))\n#define log_err(M, ...) fprintf(stderr, \"[ERROR] (%s:%d: errno: %s) \" M \"\\n\", __FILE__, __LINE__, clean_errno(), ##__VA_ARGS__)\n#define check(A, M, ...) if(!(A)) { log_err(M, ##__VA_ARGS__); errno=0; goto error; }\n\n\nHowever, the problem I encountered was that Visual Studio marks strerror() as deprecated and aborts compilation. I plan on using threads in the project, so I don't want to go the \"ignore\" route, if possible.\n\nWhat I did was I created a clean_errno() function that does the same thing as the macro, but uses a global buffer variable and calls strerror_s() to copy into it, then return a pointer to the log_err() macro.\nHowever now I have to:\n\n\neither create a brand new header and C file just for this one 3-liner function, which I think is just abundant\nor I just declare and implement the function in the debug macro's header, which isn't considered good C practice at all, and also very ugly.\n\n\nIs there any other trick/hack that I don't know of that would provide an elegant and simple solution to this?\n    ",

The unclear is just that fact, why it is made like this??The string descriptions of the error codes must be stored somewhere, most likely in some static array of strings. Therefore, instead of writing to the same pointer upon every strerror() call it would be much better just to return the corresponding element of that mentioned static array.

    "body": "\n                \nI'm doing some validation on mat-form-field inputs with Angular Material. The issue is that the mat-error message is not showing up, neither is the outline around the input field. I understand that there is a difference between using reactive forms and the template driven approach with ngModel. In my setup, I am using the latter. I've tried different things like using a template variable, using FormControl etc.\nThis happens when the mat-error element in inside the mat-form-field element, and when I Inspect the input field, I can see that the mat-error element is not being generated. If I move it outside the mat-form-field element, the error text is shown, but not the outline.\nThere is no form element around the mat-form-field elements that I can reference. The mat-form-field input fields are inside a mat-dialog.\n\n<mat-dialog-content>\n    <div class=\"select\">\n    <mat-form-field floatLabel=\"always\">\n          <input \n            type=\"text\"\n            (blur)=\"checkType()\"\n            [(ngModel)]=\"modelType\"\n            matInput\n            placeholder=\"Enter type\"\n            [disabled]=\"false\"\n            required/>\n          <mat-error *ngIf=\"typeExists\">Type already exists!</mat-error>\n        </mat-form-field>\n    </div>\n</mat-dialog-content>\n    \n\ncomponent.ts\ntypeExists: boolean = false;\ncheckType()\n  {\n    //Code that looks in a list to see if the entered value exists in it.\n    //It just sets a boolean value for typeExists, which is used to show the mat-error message\n\n    this.typeExists = existsInList1;\n  }\n\nI have tried using a template variable like this with no luck:\n<mat-dialog-content>\n    <div class=\"select\">\n    <mat-form-field floatLabel=\"always\">\n          <input \n            type=\"text\"\n            (blur)=\"checkType()\"\n            [(ngModel)]=\"modelType\"\n            #typeInput=\"ngModel\"\n            matInput\n            placeholder=\"Enter type\"\n            [disabled]=\"false\"\n            required/>\n          <mat-error *ngIf=\"typeInput.dirty && typeExists\">Type already exists!</mat-error>\n        </mat-form-field>\n    </div>\n</mat-dialog-content>\n\nSurely, I am not the only one who have had these issues, so I'm hoping someone can chip in.\n    ",

            "body": "\nIt looks like you are creating a new CKRecord every time you save.\n\nCloudKit is returning ServerRecordChanged to tell you that a record with the same recordID already exists on the server, and your attempt to save was rejected because the server record's version was different.\n\n\n  Each record has a change tag that allows the server to track when that record was saved. When you save a record, CloudKit compares the change tag in your local copy of the record with the one on the server. If the two tags do not match—meaning that there is a potential conflict—the server uses the value in the [savePolicy property of CKModifyRecordsOperation] to determine how to proceed.\n\n\nSource: CKModifyRecordsOperation Reference\n\nAlthough you are using the CKDatabase.saveRecord convenience method, this still applies. The default savePolicy is ifServerRecordUnchanged.\n\nFirst, I would suggest transitioning to CKModifyRecordsOperation, especially if you are saving multiple records. It gives you much more control over the process.\n\nSecond, you need to make changes to the CKRecord from the server, when saving changes to an existing record.

When you save a record, CloudKit compares the change tag in your local copy of the record with the one on the server. If the two tags do not match—meaning that there is a potential conflict—the server uses the value in the [savePolicy property of CKModifyRecordsOperation] to determine how to proceed.\n\n\nSource: CKModifyRecordsOperation Reference\n\nAlthough you are using the CKDatabase.saveRecord convenience method, this still applies. The default savePolicy is ifServerRecordUnchanged.\n\nFirst, I would suggest transitioning to CKModifyRecordsOperation, especially if you are saving multiple records. It gives you much more control over the process.\n\nSecond, you need to make changes to the CKRecord from the server, when saving changes to an existing record.

    "body": "\n                \nI had a switch statement in Xcode 7.3 that (after passing error: NSError as an argument) worked like so:\n\nif let code:CKErrorCode = CKErrorCode(rawValue: error.code) {\n    switch code {\n    case .NotAuthenticated: etc...\n    }\n}\n\n\nAfter migrating to Swift 3.0 in Xcode 8 beta 6, I started getting errors saying that CKErrorCode is not recognized. I'm still importing cloud, and the migration lowercased my enums and I've tried to change it like so:\n\nswitch error.code {\ncase .notAuthenticated.rawValue: etc...\n}\n\n\nbut that also seems to error (the beta seems to be buggy on my system so the errors keep disappearing and reappearing, so it's hard to tell as I code now and it may just be my system, but they persist when I compile). I've been scanning https://swift.org/migration-guide/#known-migration-issues and https://swift.org/migration-guide/ but haven't found anything yet and when I google CKErrorCode the documentation (which I'm assuming is ignoring Swift 3 since it's in beta) seems to say my previous syntax is kosher.\n\nCan anyone point me in the right direction on this? Did enums lose .rawValue? Enums seemed to have changed, but I'm having difficulty finding documentation on what I should be doing. Is there an alternative to CKErrorCode that will recognize these enum cases? Please don't tell me cloud kit error handling changed more dramatically than that :) Thanks in advance.\n    ",

The BOM would be one of these: If the input is UTF-8 and you interpret it as MacRoman or ISOLatin1, it'll appear in the string as three separate characters.

First off, my web-services are POST based.  All the parameters are POSTed to the web-service which gives me cross platform independence (I use both PHP and .NET based web-services).  I include an APIKey with all the web-service calls which maintains security in that ONLY the iOS app can communicate with the web-service.  It also gives me the ability to change that APIKey and force users to update to newer versions of the application if needed (not something I have done yet, but it's there if I need to use it.  This class depends on and uses AFNetworking.  I have used several different libraries for network communication (including the iOS included frameworks), and have found AFNetworking to be very useful and efficient for what I am doing.\n\nHere is the interface file for my class:\n\n/*\n NetworkClient.h\n\n Created by LJ Wilson on 2/3/12.\n Copyright (c) 2012 LJ Wilson.

        "That's not what DISTINCTROW does (which incidentally is synonymous with DISTINCT). If you have multiple different values for cost for each id, DISTINCT/DISTINCTROW will return multiple rows. DISTINCT/DISTINCTROW merely means you won't have duplicate rows. So, for example, if you have 3 rows with values of 50, 50 and 100, DISTINCT/DISTINCTROW will return 2 rows (one with 50 and one of 100).",

Does the existence of multiple rows imply the database is in need of some cleaning, for example? Or should you be taking the first value of 'cost', or perhaps the sum of all 'cost' for id = ls_id?\n\nEdit :\n\nYour INTO clause is attempting to write multiple rows to a single variable. Looking at your SQL, I'd say the underlying problem is that your initial query to pull back just the latest cost for each ID is being hamstrung by duplicates of pceffdate. If this is the case, this SQL :\n\nSELECT DISTINCTROW `itemcode` ID, `mlist` COST\n    FROM (SELECT `itemcode`, `pceffdate`, `mlist`\n        FROM `purchcost` a\n        where `pceffdate` = (SELECT MAX(z.`pceffdate`) FROM `purchcost` z WHERE z.`itemcode` = a.`itemcode`\n        AND z.`pceffdate` <= TDATE)) tb\n\n\nwill return more rows than just this :\n\nSELECT DISTINCTROW `itemcode` ID\n    FROM (SELECT `itemcode`, `pceffdate`, `mlist`\n        FROM `purchcost` a\n        where `pceffdate` = (SELECT MAX(z.`pceffdate`) FROM `purchcost` z WHERE z.`itemcode` = a.`itemcode`\n        AND z.`pceffdate` <= TDATE)) tb\n\n    ",

If it is possible for 1 item to have more than one entry with different mlist values for the same date/datetime, then you need to decide how that should be handled.

If those are marked identity, they cannot be altered unless you set IDENTITY_INSERT ON.\nDouble check your saveChanges model and the query behind it to make sure you're not trying to update/change/insert your primary key value.\n    ",

I understand similar question has been asked multiple times on here but i can not seem to figure out where the issue is. I was making a basic project that logs blood pressure. My thinking was that the following code would initialize the schema of a user table (to track who is logged in) and a readings table (blood pressure readings):\nCREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS bloodpressure;\n\nUSE bloodpressure;\n\nCREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS appusers (\n    userid INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,\n    username VARCHAR(25) UNIQUE NOT NULL,\n    psword VARCHAR(25) NOT NULL\n); \n\nCREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS bpreadings (\n    reading INT AUTO_INCREMENT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,\n    user_id INT NOT NULL,\n    sys DECIMAL(3 , 0 ) NOT NULL,\n    dia DECIMAL(3 , 0 ) NOT NULL,\n    pulse DECIMAL(3 , 0 ) NOT NULL,\n    FOREIGN KEY (user_id)\n        REFERENCES appusers (userid)\n);\n\nThe issue i'm running into to is the error code:\nError Code: 1364. Field 'user_id' doesnt have a default value\n\nThis is after I run:\nINSERT INTO appusers (username, psword) VALUES (\"user1\", \"pwd1\");\n\nwhich runs correctly and then try to run:\nINSERT INTO bpreadings (sys, dia, pulse) VALUES (128, 72, 88);\n\nmy original thinking was to use a FK to fill it from the userid in appusers but it does not carry over. I wouldnt think I would need a default value on readings.user_id. I also checked inserting appusers with data and the primary key userid fills fine and autoincrements correctly. I'm just struggling trying to get it to carry over. Is it something simple i am missing or is it an overall flaw in the design?\nThank you in advance!\n    ",

But I saw your question and I remember working on a project which was essentially an HTML-based remote control for the iphone, and when the user clicked on some of the buttons for the remote, it followed the urls that opened up identical pages but had server-side code to instruct the server to pause, play, stop, etc... I DO remember that the iPhone had a bug that caused it to not be able to parse all of my URLs, even though they were correctly formatted and worked on a desktop client. That is why I switched over to POST requests (where user clicks instead activated javascript functions that set hidden form variables and then submitted forms rather than directly navigating to long URLS). Anyways, I know this may not directly apply to you, but the point is that I did find a bug in the iPhone's URL parsing, so it might not be your fault. I'll look up any new information I can find a little later. Good luck.\n    ",

To see it yourself, run this piece of code:\n\nint magic = 218774561;\nByteBuffer b = ByteBuffer.allocate(4);\nb.putInt(magic);\nSystem.out.println(new String(b.array()));\n\n\nThis in combination with the applet being served by a website suggests that it's the start of a <!DOCTYPE> which in turn suggests that it's a HTML document.\n\nSo, the request to Evolution.jar has apparently actually returned a HTML document. You should be able to see it yourself when you change the current request URI in browser address bar to point to applet's URL (e.g. change /page.html in end of URL to /Evolution.jar). Then you'll see what the browser actually retrieved when it tried to download the applet. Perhaps it's a simple HTTP 404 error document.\n\nTo fix it, just make sure that the URL in the archive attribute is correct.

According to the linked discussion, these JVM's handle the newer class and method name specification:\n\n6.0.0 SR10\n6.0.1 SR1\n7.0.0 SR1\n\nIf the JVM cannot be changed, the alternative would be to modify the problem class to remove special characters from class and method names.\n\nThx!\nTom Bitonti\n    ",

However, when I tried to 'trim down' the code to this:\n\nStringBuilder info = new StringBuilder();\nfor(int i = 0; i < 10000; i++) {\n\n    info.append((int)(Math.random() * 1000))\n            .append(\" \")\n            .append(Math.random() * 100)\n            .append(\"\\n\");\n\n}\nFiles.write(Paths.get(\"something.txt\"), info.toString().getBytes());\n\n\nI received an exception:\n\n\n  java.lang.ClassFormatError: Truncated class file\n      at java.lang.ClassLoader.defineClass1(Native Method)\n      at java.lang.ClassLoader.defineClass(ClassLoader.java:763)\n      at java.security.SecureClassLoader.defineClass(SecureClassLoader.java:142)\n      at java.net.URLClassLoader.defineClass(URLClassLoader.java:467)\n      at java.net.URLClassLoader.access$100(URLClassLoader.java:73)\n      at java.net.URLClassLoader$1.run(URLClassLoader.java:368)\n      at java.net.URLClassLoader$1.run(URLClassLoader.java:362)\n      at java.security.AccessController.doPrivileged(Native Method)\n      at java.net.URLClassLoader.findClass(URLClassLoader.java:361)\n      at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(ClassLoader.java:424)\n      at sun.misc.Launcher$AppClassLoader.loadClass(Launcher.java:338)\n      at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(ClassLoader.java:357)\n      at sun.launcher.LauncherHelper.checkAndLoadMain(LauncherHelper.java:495)\n  \n  Error: A JNI error has occurred, please check your installation and try again\n  Exception in thread \"main\" \n\n\nThis is the first time I encounter such a problem. I tried to play a little with the code and realised that the problem is reproduced if the are more than one call to Math.random() per append nesting.\n\nI also tried it with other methods, such as plain old:\n\nint foo() {\n    return 42;\n}\n\n\nin place of Math.random() calls. It compiled and executed successfully.\n\nWhat it is to Math.random() that it fails here? Are there any other methods that are unsafe to use like that? What is the official term to describe this behaviour? Is this a common differentiation between methods - whether they can be called in such way? What exactly happens here and how does the exception description relate to it?\n\nEDIT: It might be the case that it's just a IDE/JDK/Configuration bug, but I am unsure about it.

I need to somehow get java's magic value, 0xCAFEBABE (hex) written to the .java file I'm writing programmatically first.  I've read all the answers to similar questions but they all point to bringing in 3rd party libraries to write the java file programmatically.  \n\nI can't help but think that there is a relatively straight forward solution to this without bringing in a 3rd party lib? How can I write a hex value to an arbitrary file? \n\nRight now, I'm taking a string.  converting it to bytes, and then writing those bytes to a FileInputStream which then dumps to a file with .java extension.  Code I'm using is below.  How can I instead of writing bytes, write hex values? Encodings are not my strong suite so this problem is really giving me some trouble. \n\nCode I'm using to write my java file: \n\npublic void writeJavaFile() throws IOException \n{\n    String testString = \"class test { public test() {} public void printTest()\n    { System.out.println(\\\"yoooo\\\");}}\";\n    String filename = \"test.java\";\n    OutputStream outputStream = new FileOutputStream(filename);\n    outputStream.write(testString.getBytes());\n    outputStream.flush();\n    outputStream.close();\n}\n\n    ",

I followed the basic steps of changing NSPersistentContainer to NSPersistenCloudKitContainer and adding iCloud capabilities, enabling CloudKit and Background Modes (remote notifications). With those few changes, data is syncing between devices as it should. Seemed very simple.\nBut, if the users iCloud storage gets full, the app continues to function and persist locally but sync stops (obviously) without notifying the user.\nI understand it's a quotaExceeded error, but how would I go about accessing that error then handling it (and handling CKErrors in general)?\nI feel like this NSPersistentCloudKitContainer is a wall that I can't get through to be able to handle CKErrors. I'm a beginner so maybe I'm missing something obvious but can't find any answers online.\nSticking with the quotaExceeded error situation:\n\nStep 1 - CKError.Code.quotaExceeded occurs.\nStep 2 - ???\nStep 3 - Notify user that their iCloud storage is full.\n\nWhat does step 2 look like?\n    ",

    "body": "\n                \nMy app uses NSPersistentCloudKitContainer to implement Coredata and iCloud synchronization data\nRecently, I received feedback from online users about data synchronization errors, and the error code is CKErrorDomain 12 .\nIn the App, I use NSPersistentCloudKitContainer.eventChangedNotification to monitor the synchronization status, the following is the specific code\nNotificationCenter.default.publisher(for: NSPersistentCloudKitContainer.eventChangedNotification)\n            .sink(receiveValue: { notification in\n                if let cloudEvent = notification.userInfo?[NSPersistentCloudKitContainer.eventNotificationUserInfoKey]\n                    as?

Trying to restart the app or restart the phone, and turn off iCloud synchronization in the system, will not make the synchronization service work again.\nOnly uninstalling and reinstalling can completely solve this problem, but users will also lose some data after uninstalling, because when the error occurs, any data generated by the user has not been successfully synchronized to iCloud, so these data will be lost after uninstalling.\nThe following is the code for CoreDataStack initialization\nprivate func setupContainer(allowCloudKitSync: Bool) -> NSPersistentCloudKitContainer {\n    let container = NSPersistentCloudKitContainer(name: containerName)\n    let privateStoreURL = containerURL.appendingPathComponent(privateStoreName)\n    let privateDescription = NSPersistentStoreDescription(url: privateStoreURL)\n    let privateOpt = NSPersistentCloudKitContainerOptions(containerIdentifier: identifier)\n    \n    privateDescription.setOption(true as NSNumber, forKey: NSPersistentHistoryTrackingKey)\n    privateDescription.setOption(true as NSNumber, forKey: NSPersistentStoreRemoteChangeNotificationPostOptionKey)\n    \n    \"allowCloudKitSync = \\(allowCloudKitSync)\".debugLog(\"CoreDataStack\")\n    \n    if allowCloudKitSync {\n        privateDescription.cloudKitContainerOptions = privateOpt\n    } else {\n        privateDescription.cloudKitContainerOptions = nil\n    }\n\n    container.persistentStoreDescriptions = [privateDescription]\n    \n    container.loadPersistentStores(completionHandler: { [weak self] (storeDescription, error) in\n        if let error = error as NSError? {\n            self?.dbStatePublish.send(.loadError)\n            #if DEBUG\n            \"Unresolved error \\(error), \\(error.userInfo)\".debugLog(\"CoreDataStack\")\n            #endif\n        } else {\n            if storeDescription.cloudKitContainerOptions == nil {\n                self?.coreDataState = .local\n            } else {\n                self?.coreDataState = .cloud\n            }\n\n            \"load coredata status = \\(String(describing: self?.coreDataState))\".debugLog(\"CoreDataStack\")\n        }\n    })\n    \n    //let options = NSPersistentCloudKitContainerSchemaInitializationOptions()        \n    //try? container.initializeCloudKitSchema(options: options)\n\n    container.viewContext.mergePolicy = NSMergeByPropertyObjectTrumpMergePolicy\n    container.viewContext.transactionAuthor = appTransactionAuthorName\n\n    // Pin the viewContext to the current generation token and set it to keep itself up to date with local changes.\n    container.viewContext.automaticallyMergesChangesFromParent = true\n    do {\n        try container.viewContext.setQueryGenerationFrom(.current)\n    } catch {\n        fatalError(\"###\\(#function): Failed to pin viewContext to the current generation:\\(error)\")\n    }\n    \n    // Observe Core Data remote change notifications.\n    NotificationCenter.default.addObserver(self,\n                                           selector: #selector(storeRemoteChange(_:)),\n                                           name: .NSPersistentStoreRemoteChange,\n                                           object: container.persistentStoreCoordinator)\n    \n    return container\n}\n\nHas anyone encountered a similar problem?
